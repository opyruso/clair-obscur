up. I’m okay, I'm okay. You go.",
ST_CS_1_1_03_TheExpeditionFestival/12_Catherine,Wanna go take a look?,
ST_CS_1_1_03_TheExpeditionFestival/05_Lucien,What? It is. Grieving alone’s the worst.,

about time we test it in real conditions.",

ST_CS_1_3_11_1_JarQuestA/04_Gustave,An expedition journal… 81.,

Why isn’t it attacking us?",

ST_CS_1_3_11_2_JarQuestB/05_Gustave,He wasn’t a Nevron.,
ST_CS_1_3_11_2_JarQuestB/12_Jar,"I would never plunge others into
darkness. I was painted to bring light.",

perhaps we can learn more…",
ST_CS_1_3_11_2_JarQuestB/09_Gustave,It really does speak.,
ST_CS_1_3_11_2_JarQuestB/16_Gustave,I’m not sure that's a good idea…,
ST_CS_1_3_11_2_JarQuestB/04_Lune,On the beach… some did disappear.,

me. Help me… Find light.",

kill seems to affect our chroma…",

disappear, like in Lumière.",

We should be safe up in the tree.",

ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/14_Lune,Everyone knows the protocol.,
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/08_Lune,"I dunno. Doesn’t sound like anyone
on the team. What if it’s a trap?",
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/13_Lune,"If it was an expeditioner,
they would have stayed here.",
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/06_Lune,"It sounds like an Expeditioner, but
everyone KNOWS to sign their messages.",
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/10_Gustave,"It’s a lead, our only lead. Whoever
this is knows Maelle. We have to go.",
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/22_Gustave,"I’ll let you choose
which protocol to break.",
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/20_Gustave,Look. I’m going after Maelle.,
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/04_Gustave,Maelle–,
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/23_Lune,Merde.,
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/11_Lune,"No, not yet. Protocol is to regroup at
the Rally Point and wait three days.",
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/01_Gustave,PUTAIN. Nobody.,
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/21_Gustave,Protocol also states “Never move solo.”,
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/16A_Gustave,"Protocol doesn’t cover every
contingency. You know that.",
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/15_Gustave,"Right, but they may have been in danger.
Maybe this location has been compromised.",
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/09_Lune,The man on the beach–,
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/17_Lune,There’s a REASON it’s protocol.,
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/16_Gustave,Things change in the field.,
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/05_Lune,"This doesn’t make sense.
Who would have written this?",
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/12_Lune,This message feels off.,
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/02_Lune,Wait. There’s a message on the wall–,
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/19_Gustave,"Was our entire team dying
part of that “optimal result?”",
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/18_Lune,"We designed it to yield the optimal
result in the vast majority of situations.",
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/07_Gustave,"Yeah, but they might’ve been in a hurry.",
ST_CS_1_3_14_IndigoTreeMessage/03_Lune,"“Took Maelle to the weird corals. Head
north. Look for a door inside a hut.”",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/13A_Gustave,"And, and Tristan, Margot, they… they all…",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/22_Lune,"As long as even one of us
stands, our fight is not over.",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/23_Gustave,"But I’m not afraid to fight,
it’s just Maelle, she’s–",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/08_Lune,But more than that… You saw his face.,
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/06_Lune,"But right now, it’s just the two of us and
I don’t want to bring Maelle your corpse.",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/27A_Lune,Do you still believe that?,
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/28_Lune,Do you?,
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/11_Gustave,"Exactly. He killed us all so easily,
he doesn’t need to fake a message.",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/04_Lune,Have you learned nothing from the beach?,
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/09_Lune,"He must be, what, 50? 60?
Yet he survived the Gommage.",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/14_Gustave,"I am not letting Maelle die
out here. I’m taking her home.",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/18_Lune,I didn’t take you for a coward.,
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/29_Gustave,I hope I do.,
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/24A_Gustave,I know that!,
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/19_Gustave,I’m not a coward.,
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/05_Gustave,"I’m not leaving Maelle alone a
minute longer than I have to.",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/01_Gustave,"I’m sorry about earlier. The
beach was not your fault–",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/13_Gustave,Lucien– Lucien died to save me.,
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/24_Lune,Maelle swore the same oath.,
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/17A_Gustave,My… my gun and… and your sparks?,
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/02_Lune,"No, it was. I convinced
Alan to land there.",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/16_Gustave,"Oh fuck the mission!
Fuck the mission Lune.",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/25_Lune,She chose her life!,
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/03_Gustave,"So uh… We can rest a bit, but the
moon is bright, I want to keep moving.",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/31_Gustave,Sorry.,
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/26A_Gustave,"Than any individual life, yes.",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/10_Lune,"We don’t know who we’re dealing
with. We lost everyone in an instant–",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/07_Lune,"We have to think every step through. The
man on the beach, you saw what he did.",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/21A_Lune,"We knew not all of us would
make it. But “WE. CONTINUE.”",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/17_Gustave,"We’re gonna take down the
Paintress, just the three of us?",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/15_Lune,"What? No, no no. We have a mission–",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/16A_Gustave,"What’re we gonna do, huh?
Tell me. What are we gonna do?",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/21_Lune,"When one falls. WHEN
one falls. Not if. When.",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/20A_Gustave,"Yes, I know.",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/27_Lune,"Yes, do you still believe that?",
ST_CS_1_3_15_PostSpringMeadows/25A_Lune,You and I… Come on… we always said,

ST_CS_1_4_1_WelcomeToTheFlyingWaters/06_Gustave,"Alright, let’s keep moving.",
ST_CS_1_4_1_WelcomeToTheFlyingWaters/05_Lune,"And they survived. The storm, at least.",
ST_CS_1_4_1_WelcomeToTheFlyingWaters/03_Gustave,"Expedition 68. Their boat was
blown into the air by a storm.",

remember everyone at the beach.",

quite different from the Nevrons.",

lot. He reinforced all my pictos.",

Excellent, excellent insult!",

ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/24_Noco,Mmmmm. Maybe.,
ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/15_Maelle,"Noco, you silly scruff!",
ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/23_Maelle,"Noco. As the BEST Gestral merchant
ever, I bet you know a solution? Yeah?",
ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/07_Maelle,Noco’s a bit dramatic.,
ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/17_Lune,Oh. Really.,
ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/27_Noco,"Ok ok, ask Golgra. Chef has the
answer, just go to the Village.",
ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/12_Lune,"So the tales are true– Perhaps the
Grandis and the Esquie exist too?",
ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/06_Maelle,"Stop that, you big hairy brushface.
Can’t you see they’re human?",
ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/21_Noco,"The Paintress? How you gonna cross the
sea? You’re so slow. And you have no fins.",
ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/16_Maelle,Their village is not far from here.,
ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/22_Lune,"There’s another sea between
here and the Paintress?",
ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/29_Gustave,"Well. I guess you’ll get
to meet more Gestrals.",
ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/20_Gustave,"Yeah, we need to get to the Paintress.",
ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/01_Lune,…the manor and maybe learn something…,
ST_CS_1_4_3_NocoIntro/02_Gustave,"…yeah or we could get
back to the Indigo Tree…",
ST_CS_1_4_4_Goblu/03_Lune,It only attacked when–,
ST_CS_1_4_4_Goblu/04_Maelle,It’s coming!,
ST_CS_1_4_4_Goblu/01_Lune,Watch out!,
ST_CS_1_4_4_Goblu/02_Gustave,You alright?,
ST_CS_1_4_5_GobluOutro/05_Gustave,"Damn Maelle, what was that?",
ST_CS_1_4_5_GobluOutro/01_Lune,"Gustave, wait!",
ST_CS_1_4_5_GobluOutro/07_Lune,"Gustave. We won’t understand what’s going
on if we kill everything that moves.",
ST_CS_1_4_5_GobluOutro/06_Maelle,It felt… familiar somehow…,
ST_CS_1_4_5_GobluOutro/02_Lune,"It seems peaceful, as long as
we don’t touch the flowers.",
ST_CS_1_4_5_GobluOutro/08_Maelle,"Look, a red tree. The Gestral
village must be ahead.",
ST_CS_1_4_5_GobluOutro/04_Gustave,PUTAIN!,
ST_CS_1_4_5_GobluOutro/10_Lune,She’ll be fine.,
ST_CS_1_4_5_GobluOutro/11_Gustave,She’ll be fine.,
ST_CS_1_4_5_GobluOutro/03_Gustave,"Yeah, well let’s not get too sentimental.
It’s still a Paintress creation.",
ST_CS_1_4_5_GobluOutro/09_Gustave,You know what Nevrons are capable of.,
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/02_Lune,A gestral village–,
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/17_Gustave,And at least there’s three of us now.,
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/08_Gustave,"And the man on the beach.
Yeah, too many unknowns.",
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/01_Gustave,Been a long time since I’ve seen you play.,
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/16_Gustave,"But I thought we can keep their
spirit alive by pushing forward.",
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/09_Gustave,"But if we take down the Paintress,",
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/05_Lune,"But there’s still too
much we don’t understand.",
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/13_Lune,Mm.,
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/07_Lune,"Seventy years and we still
barely know anything.",
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/14_Gustave,Shock’s worn off. A bit.,
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/18_Gustave,The mission hasn’t changed.,
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/04_Lune,This is ultimately a war of information.,
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/19_Lune,Tomorrow comes.,
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/20_Gustave,Tomorrow comes.,
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/15_Gustave,We can’t bring anyone back.,
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/06_Lune,"Where the Paintress comes from? Why
she does what she does. Who is she??",
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/03_Gustave,"Yeah. I still can’t believe they exist.
I mean, what other fairy tales are real?",
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/12_Gustave,Yeah? I’m holding it together?,
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/11_Lune,You seem better than– before.,
ST_CS_1_4_6_LuneCampFairytales/10_Gustave,"at least that gives future generations
a chance to unravel the mystery.",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/09A_Gustave,"And now we finally found
other survivors and it’s…",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/02_Gustave,As expected.,
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/01_Maelle,Being out here isn’t what I expected.,
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/07_Maelle,"But not– not like that–
on the beach… that man…",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/04_Maelle,"Death out here’s not like
death in Lumière, is it?",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/03_Gustave,"Hey, you okay?",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/23_Maelle,"Huh, sure…",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/11_Gustave,"It’s… predictable. Almost gentle. It makes
Lumière complacent and accepting but…",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/05_Maelle,"I– uh, I thought I was
used to losing people.",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/13_Maelle,I’ve been having nightmares.,
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/06_Maelle,"Life of a foster child, right?",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/15_Gustave,"Look. If death approaches,
I want you to run.",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/09_Gustave,"Nevrons, we were prepared for, but not…",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/16_Gustave,"No, no no. Promise me. Run. Especially
if we meet the man from the beach.",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/19_Gustave,"Oh I’m running as soon as I see
a strand of white hair. Trust me.",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/21_Maelle,"Oh, please. You’re an old
man, I can outrun you anyday…",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/18_Maelle,Only if you do the same.,
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/01A_Gustave,Still too far…,
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/12_Gustave,"The Gommage is equally violent
and death… Death is just as final.",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/22_Gustave,"There was a time when
thirty was young you know…",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/17_Gustave,"We can’t face him. You see him, you run.",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/21A_Gustave,Yeah right…,
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/14_Gustave,"Yeah, me too…",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/08_Gustave,"Yeah… yeah, I know…",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/10_Gustave,"You know that’s… that’s the
insidious thing about the Gommage.",
ST_CS_1_4_7_MaelleThePyro/20_Gustave,"You won’t even see me,
I’m running so fast.",
ST_CS_1_5_1_ArrivinginAncientSanctuary/04_Gustave,"It might be Nevrons. Be careful, okay?",
ST_CS_1_5_1_ArrivinginAncientSanctuary/01_Maelle,That’s a lot of red trees to search–,
ST_CS_1_5_1_ArrivinginAncientSanctuary/02_Lune,"They must have some sort of track
or trail leading to the village.",
ST_CS_1_5_1_ArrivinginAncientSanctuary/03_Gustave,"Wait, I hear something.",
ST_CS_1_5_2_TheGestralDidAMassacre/09_Gustave,"Hey, hey, we’re NOT Nevrons!",
ST_CS_1_5_2_TheGestralDidAMassacre/05_Gustave,I don’t see any–,
ST_CS_1_5_2_TheGestralDidAMassacre/06_Lune,I think they mean us.,
ST_CS_1_5_2_TheGestralDidAMassacre/04_Unknown,NEVRON ALERT! NEVRON ALERT!,
ST_CS_1_5_2_TheGestralDidAMassacre/08_Gustave,Oh fucking–,
ST_CS_1_5_2_TheGestralDidAMassacre/02_Gustave,That’s a lot of dead Nevrons.,
ST_CS_1_5_2_TheGestralDidAMassacre/07_Maelle,"They must be Gestrals! They’re
cute but they’re idiots.",
ST_CS_1_5_2_TheGestralDidAMassacre/03_Lune,Who did–,
ST_CS_1_5_2_TheGestralDidAMassacre/01_Maelle,Wow–,
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/01_Maelle,"Don’t worry, we don’t want to
hurt you, Patate. Noco sent us.",
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/12_Karatom,"Follow me. There are
lots more Sakapatates.",
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/07_Maelle,"Guide us to your village, and maybe
he’ll make you something better.",
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/09_Karatom,How do I know you’re not lying?,
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/04_Lune,If you guide us to your village–,
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/11_Karatom,Mmmmmmm. OK DEAL!,
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/03_Karatom,"OH! DID NOCO SEND YOU TO HELP
US BUILD A BETTER SAKAPATATE?!",
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/05_Karatom,"OOOOOH, what’s this? Coooool.",
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/06_Karatom,"Ok, deal! Give me the arm for our
Sakapatate and I’ll show you the village.",
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/02_Karatom,"Our Sakapatate was supposed to be
INVINCIBLE. Wait– Noco sent you?",
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/15_Maelle,They’re less complicated.,
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/10_Maelle,"Trust me, I hate liars.",
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/08_Gustave,"Wait, what d’you–",
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/13_Karatom,"You’ll be fine, just don’t die.",
ST_CS_1_5_3_PostSakapatate/14_Gustave,You’re better with Gestrals than humans.,
ST_CS_1_5_4_UltimateSakapatateArrives/02_Peron,But they’re human.,
ST_CS_1_5_4_UltimateSakapatateArrives/07_Tropa,"En garde, warriors! Face
our ULTIMATE CREATION!",
ST_CS_1_5_4_UltimateSakapatateArrives/10_Gustave,"Hey, don’t get cocky, Maelle.
Look at its equipment.",
ST_CS_1_5_4_UltimateSakapatateArrives/01_Tropa,"INTRUDER ALERT! INTRUDER ALERT!
Send forth the ULTIMATE WEAPON!",
ST_CS_1_5_4_UltimateSakapatateArrives/08_Maelle,Kinda looks the same as all the others.,
ST_CS_1_5_4_UltimateSakapatateArrives/04_Peron,"Oh yeah, so cool, so cool!",
ST_CS_1_5_4_UltimateSakapatateArrives/03_Tropa,"Shhh. Now’s our chance to test the
Ultimate Sakapatate in a REAL fight.",
ST_CS_1_5_4_UltimateSakapatateArrives/11_Gustave,"That looks a lot more dangerous
than the others. No, seriously.",
ST_CS_1_5_4_UltimateSakapatateArrives/05_Gustave,They sound like kids.,
ST_CS_1_5_4_UltimateSakapatateArrives/09_Karatom,"Those were supposed to be invincible,
but this one is even MORE invincible.",
ST_CS_1_5_4_UltimateSakapatateArrives/06_Lune,We must be getting close to the Village.,
ST_CS_1_5_5_TheEndOfTheUltimateSakapatate/04_Maelle,Chef?,
ST_CS_1_5_5_TheEndOfTheUltimateSakapatate/06_Karatom,"Golgra will wanna see
you right away. Let’s go!",
ST_CS_1_5_5_TheEndOfTheUltimateSakapatate/05_Karatom,"Golgra! The BEST FIGHTER of ALL the
Gestrals EVER, alive OR hibernating.",
ST_CS_1_5_5_TheEndOfTheUltimateSakapatate/01_Tropa,Nooooooooooo!,
ST_CS_1_5_5_TheEndOfTheUltimateSakapatate/03_Karatom,"Oh you’re good! Chef’s
definitely gonna wanna meet you.",
ST_CS_1_5_5_TheEndOfTheUltimateSakapatate/02_Peron,This Sakapatate is GARBAGE!,
ST_CS_1_6_3_ScielTheWarrior/01_GestralAnnouncer,"And NOW. The one who single-handedly
destroyed a Sakapatate",
ST_CS_1_6_3_ScielTheWarrior/09_GestralAnnouncer,"Hey humans! We’re here
to see some fighting.",
ST_CS_1_6_3_ScielTheWarrior/08_Lune,How did you get here?,
ST_CS_1_6_3_ScielTheWarrior/07_Sciel,I knew you were resourceful.,
ST_CS_1_6_3_ScielTheWarrior/06_Sciel,I thought I was the only one left–,
ST_CS_1_6_3_ScielTheWarrior/10_GestralAnnouncer,"If you don’t wanna fight, we’ll
come down and fight ourselves!",
ST_CS_1_6_3_ScielTheWarrior/04_Gustave,Sciel?!,
ST_CS_1_6_3_ScielTheWarrior/12_Sciel,Shall we?,
ST_CS_1_6_3_ScielTheWarrior/11_Sciel,They’re expecting a bit of a show.,
ST_CS_1_6_3_ScielTheWarrior/03_Maelle,Wait– That’s–!,
ST_CS_1_6_3_ScielTheWarrior/05_Sciel,What– How– You guys– You’re alive!,
ST_CS_1_6_3_ScielTheWarrior/02_GestralAnnouncer,"to EARN HER SPOT in the Hall
of Legends. THE. STRANGER!",
ST_CS_1_6_5_PostGestralTournamentCS/04_Sciel,Am I one of those old people?,
ST_CS_1_6_5_PostGestralTournamentCS/07A_Sciel,"But luckily I met a
Gestral who guided me here.",
ST_CS_1_6_5_PostGestralTournamentCS/07_Sciel,Had to dodge a few Nevrons.,
ST_CS_1_6_5_PostGestralTournamentCS/05A_Gustave,"Hey, how’d you end up here?",
ST_CS_1_6_5_PostGestralTournamentCS/11_Gustave,No time to lose.,
ST_CS_1_6_5_PostGestralTournamentCS/06_Sciel,"Oh, um. After the beach– I ended up in an
odd yellow forest, not too far from here.",
ST_CS_1_6_5_PostGestralTournamentCS/05_Gustave,One day. I hope.,
ST_CS_1_6_5_PostGestralTournamentCS/03_Maelle,So it wasn’t so bad.,
ST_CS_1_6_5_PostGestralTournamentCS/09_Gustave,"Um… Well, I– I woke up
next to a waterfall and…",
ST_CS_1_6_5_PostGestralTournamentCS/10_Lune,"We can talk later. Let’s
get back to Golgra.",
ST_CS_1_6_5_PostGestralTournamentCS/01_Maelle,"Well, that wasn’t so bad.",
ST_CS_1_6_5_PostGestralTournamentCS/08_Sciel,What about you?,
ST_CS_1_6_5_PostGestralTournamentCS/02_Gustave,"Yeah, really just felt
like beating old people.",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/06_MirrorRenoir,"Alicia. I told you to stay home.
It’s not good for you to see this.",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/03_Maelle,Do you feel someth–,
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/22_Maelle,For everyone.,
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/20_Maelle,"He said– He said we need to go…
home. And that it’s– It’s my fault?",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/30_Gustave,"Hey, hey. Breathe. Listen to me. You’re
safe. Do you understand? Okay? It’s over.",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/13_Sciel,Hey–,
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/01_Sciel,"I can’t believe it, we’re
gonna meet THE Esquie.",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/12_Sciel,I can’t wait to see–,
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/28_Lune,"I know this is hard, but I need you to
focus, okay? While the details are fresh.",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/15_Maelle,"It was him! I saw him! The
white-haired man– And this woman–",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/07_MirrorRenoir,"It’s her fault and she doesn’t even
know it. But you can’t be here.",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/24_Gustave,"It’s ok, it’s ok, it’s over.",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/27_Sciel,"Lune, maybe later.",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/29_Gustave,Lune. Ask her tomorrow.,
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/18_Lune,"Maelle, breathe. Slow down.",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/14_Gustave,"Maelle? Hey, hey, hey…",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/10_MirrorRenoir,"Now take your friends and go home. Let
them spend their final year in peace.",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/26_Maelle,She– She had a mask– And–,
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/21_Maelle,That I’m– I’m gonna make things… worse.,
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/02_Lune,"The Gestrals. And Esquie.
The tales are true!",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/11_MirrorRenoir,This is your only warning.,
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/16_Gustave,Wai- Where– What are you talking about?,
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/08_Maelle,"What are you talking about?
What’s my fault?! What is this?!",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/17_Lune,What did you see?,
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/19_Lune,"What did you see? Think carefully.
Every detail could be important.",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/25_Lune,What else? You said there was a woman?,
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/04_Maelle,White hair…,
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/05_Maelle,Who are you?,
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/06A_MirrorRenoir,"Yes. Yes, I understand.",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/09_MirrorRenoir,"You should never have come. You’re only
going to make things worse. For everyone.",
ST_CS_1_6_7_ForcedCampPostGestralVillage/23_Maelle,"You were all– frozen. I couldn’t– I
couldn’t– It was like– a waking nightmare.",
ST_CS_1_7_1_EnteringEsquiesNest/06_Gustave,Ahem. GET OUT OF MY WAY.,
ST_CS_1_7_1_EnteringEsquiesNest/05_Sciel,"Come on, don’t be shy.",
ST_CS_1_7_1_EnteringEsquiesNest/11_Maelle,"Come on, it’s a gestral, he’ll
have forgotten in about a minute.",
ST_CS_1_7_1_EnteringEsquiesNest/07_Sunniso,"Geez, you don’t need to be so rude.",
ST_CS_1_7_1_EnteringEsquiesNest/02_Sciel,"Golgra said to shout the
password “as loud as we can.”",
ST_CS_1_7_1_EnteringEsquiesNest/04A_Gustave,Hey.,
ST_CS_1_7_1_EnteringEsquiesNest/10A_Gustave,"It’s just that Golgra told
us that’s the password and I-",
ST_CS_1_7_1_EnteringEsquiesNest/12_Gustave,I’m sorry.,
ST_CS_1_7_1_EnteringEsquiesNest/10_Gustave,"Look, I am very sorry.",
ST_CS_1_7_1_EnteringEsquiesNest/08_Gustave,"Nononono, uh… it’s just,
um… it’s the password…",
ST_CS_1_7_1_EnteringEsquiesNest/01_Sunniso,"Oh hi little humans, you
need the password to enter.",
ST_CS_1_7_1_EnteringEsquiesNest/04_Gustave,Really?,
ST_CS_1_7_1_EnteringEsquiesNest/03_Sciel,"Well, Gustave, you’re the loudest.",
ST_CS_1_7_1_EnteringEsquiesNest/09_Sunniso,"Well, I don’t know! Golgra never told me
the password. But whatever, just go in.",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/03_Esquie,"Bonjour, mes amis!",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/28_Esquie,But Florrie was stolen by my archnemesis!,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/22_Esquie,But I’m not that strong.,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/37_Esquie,"FAN-TASTIC! Good luck, mes amis!
Please bring Florrie back to me!",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/35_Esquie,François is my neighbour.,

ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/01_Lune,"Hmm, no Esquie–",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/40_Sciel,How–? I don’t understand–,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/17_Gustave,I don’t get it.,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/23_Esquie,I will need Florrie.,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/15_Sciel,"In the stories, they say Esquie
likes to speak in riddles.",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/16_Esquie,In what way?,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/21_Esquie,I’m strong.,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/32_Gustave,"Let me guess. François is located deep
in Nevron-infested territory, right?",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/20_Esquie,Mmm. There’s a lot of you to carry.,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/13_Esquie,"Mon ami! “A rolling
stone gathers no moss.”",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/09_Sciel,"No? Uh. I’m not– I’m
not that fond of water.",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/18_Esquie,OHOHO!,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/07_Esquie,"Oh! It’s you! Hello again
my terrible swimmer friend.",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/33_Esquie,"Oh, no, he’s right next door. Over there!",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/34_Gustave,Oh.,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/10_Esquie,Ok!,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/31_Lune,Ok.,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/42_Sciel,Okay…,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/36_Gustave,"Okay… Well, I guess we could take a look-",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/25_Esquie,One of my rocks!,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/14_Lune,Pardon me?,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/26_Maelle,Rocks?,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/05_Lune,Sciel.,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/27_Esquie,"See, Florrie helps me swim.",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/29_Esquie,"The one whose every step SHAKES the
foundation of the world! The one known as…",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/11_Gustave,"Uh. Actually, that’s
sort of why we’re here.",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/02_Esquie,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/12_Gustave,"We need to cross the sea.
Golgra said you could help?",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/19_Lune,"We really need to cross the
sea. Would you please help us?",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/06_Sciel,"What? I dunno, he seems nice.",
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/24_Sciel,Who’s Florrie?,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/39_Esquie,Yes.,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/38_Sciel,You seem to know me.,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/08_Esquie,You’ve finally come to learn to swim!,
ST_CS_1_7_2_MeetingEsquie/41_Esquie,"“Men trip not on mountains,
they stumble upon stones.”",
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/07_Francois,"A ROCK? I am NOT a rock,
do you have rocks for eyes?",
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/09_Francois,ESQUIE! Stop sending hooligans over here!,
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/15_Francois,"HUMANS! Well! OVER MY
DEAD BODY. RAAAAAAHHHHH!",
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/05_Maelle,He’s just a talking rock!,
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/04_Maelle,Is that– Are you François?,
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/13_Lune,"It’s ok, we’ll leave, we’re
just here for Florrie.",
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/12_Francois,Now get off my lawn!,
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/14_Francois,"So not only are you intruding,
you’re here to STEAL? Oh, my word.",
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/10_Esquie,Stop being a meanie. They’re nice humans.,
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/11_Francois,Then keep them on your side of the caves!,
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/01_Lune,There’s nothing here.,
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/06_Gustave,"Wait, I thought Florrie was the rock?",
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/02_Francois,Who dares enter my lair?!,
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/03_Francois,"You can’t just walk into someone’s home
without knocking. That is incredibly rude.",
ST_CS_1_7_3_Francois/08_Francois,"You certainly have rocks for
BRAINS. I am clearly a TURTLE.",
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/12_Esquie,"Alas! I’ve lost them all. I can
do MUCH MORE than swim. I can FLY!",
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/17_Esquie,"Alllll the way to the north!
Just aim for the big “33.”",
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/08_Lune,"Can’t you swim without– Florrie?
We saw you flying just now?",
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/05_Esquie,"Eeeeh bah, he got me good.",
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/04_Francois,"Ha! I never HAD Florrie! Your rock
is still on the Stone Wave Cliffs!",
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/07_Esquie,"If you promise to get me
Florrie, then we can be buddies.",
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/13_Esquie,"Into SPAAAAACE! I used to fly all
the time with my best friend Verso!",
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/18_Esquie,I’ll meet you outside!,
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/09_Esquie,"Like I said. Not with
all of you on my back.",
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/15_Esquie,"Oh, how lovely of you!",
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/02_Esquie,That’s not Florrie.,
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/16_Gustave,"Wait, François said the Stone
Wave Cliffs. Where’s that?",
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/06_Gustave,"Wait, does this mean you won’t help us?",
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/14_Lune,We’ll help you find your stones.,
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/03_Lune,What do you mean “that’s not Florrie?”,
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/01_Esquie,You got Florrie!,
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/11_Lune,Your rocks?,
ST_CS_1_7_5_EsquieJoinsTheGroup/10_Esquie,You’re much too heavy. I need my rocks!,
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/08_Sciel,Aquafarm 3. That was so long ago.,
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/08A_Gustave,Aquafarm 3. Yeah.,
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/13_Gustave,"Hey, we’re still making a difference.",
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/05_Gustave,"Hm, nah…",
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/07_Gustave,"I would never abandon
a member of Aquafarm 3.",
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/06_Sciel,I'm glad you're here.,
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/12_Sciel,"Kinda nostalgic, thinking back. We really
thought we were making a difference.",
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/04_Sciel,"Mm, no.",
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/11_Sciel,"That was a good project. It fed
so many neighbourhoods at once.",
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/03_Gustave,Wanna talk about it?,
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/10_Gustave,"Yeah, we were.",
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/15_Gustave,Yeah.,
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/02_Sciel,Yeah. Sorry. Just… bad memories.,
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/14_Sciel,Yes. Of course!,
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/09_Sciel,"You and Sophie were
inseparable on that project.",
ST_CS_1_7_6_ForcedCampSciel/01_Gustave,"You ok? You’ve been quiet
since we left the Village.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/13_Gustave,"And uh, you know now I feel a little less
lost, ‘cause at least we’re lost together.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/05_Maelle,"And, and I feel like
I– I never understood,",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/11_Gustave,"But it helps, you know, to focus
on the things I do understand.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/19_Maelle,I believe that.,
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/04_Maelle,I don’t understand what’s happening.,
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/17_Maelle,"I heard that was because you
were only thinking about girls.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/24_Maelle,I know.,
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/01_Maelle,I see why you like throwing rocks.,
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/25_Gustave,"I told you don’t get cocky, it was… okay.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/07_Maelle,"In Lumière, life never made sense
and I never fit and now out here,",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/03_Maelle,"It felt like they knew me.
Like they actually knew me.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/27_Maelle,Nah.,
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/21_Gustave,"Or that’s what the
paperwork says, at least.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/12_Gustave,"The people I care about
and who care about me.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/10_Gustave,"They just make us feel
small and powerless.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/16_Gustave,"Well if it makes you feel better,
I was even more lost when I was 16.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/22_Maelle,"Well, the paperwork probably
says we’re dead, too, so…",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/14_Gustave,What? Stop it. Too cheesy? Naah.,
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/09_Gustave,"Yeah, I hate it too.
Things we don’t understand.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/18_Gustave,"Yeah, but guess what, the girls
weren’t thinking about me. At all.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/19A_Gustave,Yeah.,
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/23_Gustave,"Yeah. Probably. Ooh, nice one.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/20_Gustave,"You can talk to me,
you know. We’re family.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/26_Maelle,You taught me great.,
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/02_Gustave,"You’ve been quiet since
you saw those people.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/15_Maelle,[tense laugh],
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/06_Maelle,"like I’m always missing something
that everyone else just gets.",
ST_CS_1_7_7_DependsWhichFamily/08_Maelle,"when it was just starting to maybe feel
good, then this… this happens, and…",
ST_CS_1_7_8_AliciasNightPoem/03_MirrorAlicia,"A fresh dawn in their playground, while
we live in shadows, swimming in ink.",
ST_CS_1_7_8_AliciasNightPoem/02_MirrorAlicia,"And those who live, blithe and free,
sins forgotten and thus absolved.",
ST_CS_1_7_8_AliciasNightPoem/07_MirrorAlicia,Do you know? We are fellows.,
ST_CS_1_7_8_AliciasNightPoem/01_MirrorAlicia,"I envy them, those who can’t see.
Those who know not, that they are not.",
ST_CS_1_7_8_AliciasNightPoem/05_MirrorAlicia,"That iron dirt, that eternal
law. Those who can’t see.",
ST_CS_1_7_8_AliciasNightPoem/06_MirrorAlicia,"Those who know not, that they are not,",
ST_CS_1_7_8_AliciasNightPoem/08_MirrorAlicia,"Those who know not, that they are not.",
ST_CS_1_7_8_AliciasNightPoem/04_MirrorAlicia,"We are but a fragile dream, a singular
weed, resisting, ever resisting,",
ST_CS_1_8_1_EnteringCliffs/12_Gustave,"All right, let's go.",
ST_CS_1_8_1_EnteringCliffs/11_Sciel,Apparently so. But also lazy.,
ST_CS_1_8_1_EnteringCliffs/02_Sciel,"Apparently that was where
people went on dates, you know.",
ST_CS_1_8_1_EnteringCliffs/08_Maelle,"Come on, you can fly, can’t
you get Florrie yourself?",
ST_CS_1_8_1_EnteringCliffs/07_Esquie,"Mes amis! Florrie is close, I can feel it!",
ST_CS_1_8_1_EnteringCliffs/04_Gustave,"No, actually, my guess is
this was Expedition 50.",
ST_CS_1_8_1_EnteringCliffs/09_Esquie,"Oh no, too much effort.",
ST_CS_1_8_1_EnteringCliffs/06_Sciel,"Okay, okay professor.",
ST_CS_1_8_1_EnteringCliffs/10_Gustave,"So, wait. Esquie is that powerful?",
ST_CS_1_8_1_EnteringCliffs/01_Sciel,Wanna go for a ride?,
ST_CS_1_8_1_EnteringCliffs/13_Sciel,What a weird creature.,
ST_CS_1_8_1_EnteringCliffs/03_Sciel,"What do you think
happened in those cabins?",
ST_CS_1_8_1_EnteringCliffs/05_Gustave,"You see, they created this giant wheel
and they tried to cross the world.",
ST_CS_1_8_2_MeetingTheLampmaster/01_Gustave,"Alright, let’s get rid of him,
the rock should be nearby.",
ST_CS_1_8_3_LampmasterPhase2/01_Maelle,Easier than expected.,
ST_CS_1_8_3_LampmasterPhase2/02_Gustave,"Hey, don’t jinx us. No
need to invite misfortune.",
ST_CS_1_8_3_LampmasterPhase2/03_Lune,I don’t see any stones.,
ST_CS_1_8_3_LampmasterPhase2/05_Gustave,Misfortune.,
ST_CS_1_8_3_LampmasterPhase2/04_Maelle,What’s happening?,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/05_Esquie,All right! Ready to sail like a snail!,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/13D_Maelle,Does it really matter?,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/17_Lune,Esquie get us up there!,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/19_Lune,"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!",
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/15_Maelle,Gustave!,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/13F_Maelle,Gustave…,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/10_Gustave,"Hey, you can do this.",
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/18_Esquie,I can’t!,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/11_Sciel,I hate water.,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/01_Maelle,Is it really dead?,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/03_Sciel,Is this it?,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/06_Esquie,"Just jump, mes amis! It’s not that high!",
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/02_Gustave,Looks like it.,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/13C_Gustave,Okay.,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/13C2_Gustave,"Ooh, what about that one?",
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/04_Esquie,Oooh! FLORRIE!,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/14_Gustave,Run.,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/20_Maelle,Run… Please run.,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/12_Gustave,"She doesn’t seem that far now, does she?",
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/16_Sciel,Something’s going on up there.,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/13A_Gustave,The others are waiting but…,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/13_Maelle,Wanna throw one more rock?,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/07_Lune,We can finally cross the sea.,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/13E_Gustave,"Well you know, like I always say, it’s
not about the rock, it’s more about the-",
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/21_Gustave,Why… Why are you doing this?,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/09_Esquie,Wine?,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/12A_Maelle,Yeah.,
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/08_Sciel,"You don’t happen to have some
wine stashed away do you?",
ST_CS_1_8_4A_GustaveFinalAct/13B_Maelle,You might reach her.,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/12_RealRenoir,"-when this is over,
we’ll go home together.",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/20_MirrorRenoir,"A lifetime. A lifetime with my family
torn apart. No, I want my family back.",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/22_Verso,But she is.,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/09_RealRenoir,"But since you’re here now, just stay put–",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/01A_Gustave,"For those who come after, right?",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/01C_Maelle,GUSTAVE!,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/27_Verso,Go.,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/25_Verso,"Hey, are you alright?",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/16_MirrorRenoir,It’s been a while.,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/21_Verso,It’s not your family.,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/26_Verso,"It’s okay. I’ll handle things
here. Get back to your friends.",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/15_MirrorRenoir,"I’m sorry you’re caught in the
middle. But I did try to warn you.",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/08_RealRenoir,"My sweet child, you were supposed to
stay home. I told you not to worry.",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/01B_Maelle,No no no no… You promised…,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/13_Aline,No!,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/02_Maelle,Nonononono–,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/24_Verso,"She chose to come. I didn’t
make the rules between you two.",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/30_Verso,She’ll never paint again.,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/28_MirrorRenoir,So that’s it.,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/17_MirrorRenoir,Stay out of this. You chose to walk away.,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/14_MirrorRenoir,"This won’t make sense to you now, but we
both want what’s best for our families.",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/10_Aline,What are you saying?,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/18_MirrorRenoir,"You don’t get to come
back now and interfere.",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/06_Aline,"You know she’s too weak for this, how
could you let her take such a risk?",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/05_Aline,You let her come?!,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/11_Aline,"You must go home, NOW.
This does not involve you.",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/07_RealRenoir,"You only care when things
are right in front of you.",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/03_MirrorRenoir,"You won’t yet understand. But
this is a kindness, not a cruelty.",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/23_MirrorRenoir,You would use her?,
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/19_Verso,"You’ve lived more than a
lifetime. It’s time to let her go.",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/29_MirrorRenoir,"You’ve set us down this path, but
are you ready for the consequences?",
ST_CS_1_8_4B_GustaveFinalActPart2/04_Maelle,[full-throated scream],
ST_CS_2_10_1_MeetingMonoco/12_Verso,"Be careful though, Monoco’s
fighting style is a bit… peculiar.",
ST_CS_2_10_1_MeetingMonoco/05A_Monoco,Did Verso pull you into another adventure?,
ST_CS_2_10_1_MeetingMonoco/05_Monoco,Esquie!,
ST_CS_2_10_1_MeetingMonoco/01_Verso,"If Monoco’s not here, that means–",
ST_CS_2_10_1_MeetingMonoco/09_Monoco,"Ladies. Could I- OW–
interest you in a duel?",
ST_CS_2_10_1_MeetingMonoco/04_Esquie,MOMO!,
ST_CS_2_10_1_MeetingMonoco/06_Monoco,Mmm. New friends?,
ST_CS_2_10_1_MeetingMonoco/11_Verso,"No point trying to talk until we’ve calmed
Monoco down with a “relaxing” fight.",
ST_CS_2_10_1_MeetingMonoco/02_Verso,"Slow as ever, mon vieux.",
ST_CS_2_10_1_MeetingMonoco/08_Verso,"We had a lot of time to
kill, so I taught him.",
ST_CS_2_10_1_MeetingMonoco/10_Maelle,"Yep, definitely a Gestral.",
ST_CS_2_10_1_MeetingMonoco/07_Lune,You speak our language?,
ST_CS_2_10_1_MeetingMonoco/03_Monoco,"Your reflexes remain
sharp as ever. I approve.",
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/10A_Monoco,A Stalact.,
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/12_Monoco,"Defeat the Stalact with
your fearsome talents!",
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/05_Noco,"Even with Esquie, you’re still so slow!",
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/11_Monoco,"Friends of Verso. As “Honoured
Guests,” the first fight is yours!",
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/03_Monoco,"No distractions son! I’m really
busy beating up strangers.",
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/04_Maelle,Noco? What’re you doing here?,
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/08_Noco,Oh yeah! A Stalact is approaching!,
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/06_Noco,Oh! Where’s the man with the weird arm?,
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/02_Noco,"Oh, hi!",
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/14_Sciel,Oh.,
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/10_Monoco,Oh. Hm.,
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/13_Sciel,Right.,
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/09_Noco,"The Grandis are taking
cover. Come on, come on!",
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/07_Verso,"Uh, Noco, you said Nevron?",
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/01_Noco,Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo! NEVRON!,
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/15_Verso,"Yes, he is.",
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/16_Verso,You little coward.,
ST_CS_2_10_2_StalactAttack/14A_Sciel,You're serious.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/33_Monoco,"As a responsible parent, this is a
superb idea. Let us go. To Old Lumière.",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/22_Monoco,Count me in then.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/06_Verso,"Don’t ask me how it works,
I’ve never understood.",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/21_Verso,Exactly.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/23_Verso,Good.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/24_Monoco,Good.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/25_Verso,Good.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/26_Monoco,Good.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/05_Verso,He transforms by collecting Nevron feet.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/11_Verso,"Hey, come on. Hey!",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/11A_Verso,"Hey, look, I know we failed before, but–",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/04_Monoco,I just need…,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/16A_Monoco,I will never join you again.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/36_Noco,"If you want to go to old Lumière, you
should take this exit then head north.",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/02_Verso,Jealous?,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/12_Verso,"Look, you doofus, don’t you recognize her?",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/28_Maelle,Noco’s coming too.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/30_Noco,Not a lot of merchants go to Old Lumière!,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/07_Monoco,"Now that we’ve had some good
battles to warm the spirits.",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/13_Monoco,Of course I do–,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/34_Noco,"Oh the Grandis came out now
that the Stalact is gone!",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/18_Monoco,"Oh yeah, that’s true.",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/10_Monoco,"Okay, bye.",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/16_Monoco,Out of the question.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/32_Noco,"THE UNDISPUTED. TOP
MERCHANT. IN THE WORLD!",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/14_Verso,"Then you know what that means. This is
our shot, it might be our only shot.",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/17_Verso,There will be a lot of fighting though.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/20_Monoco,There will be a lot of fighting.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/31_Noco,"There will be tons of rare shiny
treasure and then I shall be–",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/15_Monoco,This is YOUR only shot.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/08_Monoco,"To what do we owe the
pleasure of your company?",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/09_Verso,We are heading for Old Lumière.,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/03_Sciel,What are you doing?,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/19_Verso,"Yeah, it’s true.",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/27_Verso,"Yes, good.",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/29_Verso,You are??,
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/35_Noco,"You should go talk to them,
they're nicer than Gestrals.",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/01_Monoco,"You’ve found worthy friends, Verso.",
ST_CS_2_10_3_MonocoJoinsTheGroup/04A_Monoco,…the foot. Aha!,
ST_CS_2_11_1_ArrivingInOldLumiere/02A_Verso,"Alright, show off a bit, Monoco.",
ST_CS_2_11_1_ArrivingInOldLumiere/01_Lune,Hm. We’ll need a way forward.,
ST_CS_2_11_1_ArrivingInOldLumiere/03_Monoco,Just admit you can’t do it yourself.,
ST_CS_2_11_1_ArrivingInOldLumiere/05_Lune,"Monoco, why the hell did you–",
ST_CS_2_11_1_ArrivingInOldLumiere/04_Verso,PUTAIN! Monoco!,
ST_CS_2_11_1_ArrivingInOldLumiere/09_Lune,"Right. Okay, Monoco, stop
crying, we have to move.",
ST_CS_2_11_1_ArrivingInOldLumiere/06_Monoco,"Sorry. I fucked up. I
just wanted to show off.",
ST_CS_2_11_1_ArrivingInOldLumiere/02_Verso,The heart is in the centre of the city.,
ST_CS_2_11_1_ArrivingInOldLumiere/08_Sciel,"Verso said the heart is in the
centre of Old Lumière, right?",
ST_CS_2_11_1_ArrivingInOldLumiere/07_Sciel,"We just have to regroup,
the others should be fine.",
ST_CS_2_11_1_ArrivingInOldLumiere/10_Monoco,Yes. Sorry.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/16_Sciel,"58. They were the ones that
Verso was travelling with?",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/34A_Verso,After you.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/19_Lune,An Axon. Interesting.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/30_Noco,And find treasures along the way!,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/14_Lune,Any idea what this is?,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/25_Verso,Can you stand?,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/06_Sciel,Do you trust him?,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/01_Sciel,"Doesn’t that look like
one of Esquie’s stones?",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/31_Maelle,Feels like home.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/28_Verso,"Good. The others are probably heading
toward the centre of the city.",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/09_Sciel,He has been helpful.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/12_Lune,"He mentioned travelling
with other expeditions.",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/05_Lune,"He seems to be our best bet for
now. We lack too much information.",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/11_Monoco,"Hm. I don’t really remember. I
feel like I’ve always known Verso.",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/13B_Monoco,Hmmmm… Hmmm… What happened to them…,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/13A_Lune,How many? What happened to them?,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/17_Lune,I believe so.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/07_Lune,"I trust that he wants
to reach the Paintress.",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/04_Sciel,"I was surprised you agreed
so readily to Verso’s plans.",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/21_Lune,Is this true?,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/15_Monoco,"I’m afraid not. This is my
first time here as well.",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/03_Sciel,Let’s bring him a gift.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/22_Sciel,Maelle’s with him.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/13C_Sciel,Maybe ask Verso when we find him.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/33_Maelle,"Monoco fits well in the
Disaster Expedition, eh?",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/26_Verso,Monoco gets a bit carried away sometimes.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/10_Lune,"Monoco, how did you meet Verso?",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/27_Maelle,"My back hurts, but I’m fine.",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/02_Lune,"Oh, yeah.",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/13_Monoco,Quite a few.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/08_Lune,"So for now, our interests are aligned.",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/09A_Sciel,"Still, I have this feeling
he’s hiding something.",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/18_Lune,They made it surprisingly far.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/20_Lune,Verso is–,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/24_Monoco,Verso would never harm her.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/23_Lune,We need to go. NOW.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/29_Verso,We’ll rejoin them there.,
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/32_Verso,"Yeah, feels like home.",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/34_Verso,"Yeah, he does.",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/13D_Lune,"Yeah, okay. Finding them comes first.",
ST_CS_2_11_2_DiscoveringTheTruth/32A_Verso,You ok?,
ST_CS_2_11_3_VersoDisappears/04_Maelle,Putain. What– Where did he go?,
ST_CS_2_11_3_VersoDisappears/03_Maelle,VERSO?!,
ST_CS_2_11_3_VersoDisappears/02_Maelle,Verso?,
ST_CS_2_11_3_VersoDisappears/01_Maelle,We’re a pretty good team.,
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/10_MirrorRenoir,"Easier to betray us, if I’m the villain.",
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/18_Verso,Family is not my favourite topic.,
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/04_MirrorRenoir,How many times must you hurt our family.,
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/01_Verso,I knew you’d open the door for her.,
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/19A_Verso,"I’d really like for you
all to survive this.",
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/12_Maelle,I’m gonna fucking kill him.,
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/02_Verso,Merde!,
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/05_Verso,"No. No, you don’t get
to lecture ME on family.",
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/09_MirrorRenoir,"Of course it’s easier for
you to think that, isn’t it.",
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/03_MirrorRenoir,"Really, Verso? This was your plan?",
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/19_Verso,"Right, can we talk about this later?",
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/14_Lune,"Sorry we’re late, we were
busy doing a bit of reading.",
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/11_Maelle,"Verso, move.",
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/15_Lune,"Were you planning on
sharing that this man,",
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/06_MirrorRenoir,"Why do you refuse to see
I am doing this for us.",
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/07_MirrorRenoir,Yet you insist on rushing toward death.,
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/13_MirrorRenoir,"You haven’t told her the truth,",
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/17_Maelle,Your father.,
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/08_Verso,You’re doing this for yourself.,
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/07A_MirrorRenoir,You’re trying to stop the wrong cycle.,
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/13A_MirrorRenoir,"have you, son?",
ST_CS_2_11_4_MirrorRenoirRound2/16_Lune,"the man who murdered our
team, is your father?",
ST_CS_2_11_5_NocosDeath/09_Verso,"ALICIA, MOVE!",
ST_CS_2_11_5_NocosDeath/01_Verso,Everyone all right?,
ST_CS_2_11_5_NocosDeath/14_Verso,Fuck! [angry roar],
ST_CS_2_11_5_NocosDeath/02_Verso,Monoco?,
ST_CS_2_11_5_NocosDeath/13_Verso,"No, no, no, no. Alicia!",
ST_CS_2_11_5_NocosDeath/03_Monoco,Noco’s– broken.,
ST_CS_2_11_5_NocosDeath/05_Sciel,No–,
ST_CS_2_11_5_NocosDeath/12_Verso,Putain! Where did it go?,
ST_CS_2_11_5_NocosDeath/10_Maelle,What is tha–,
ST_CS_2_11_5_NocosDeath/08_MirrorRenoir,Why can’t you accept who you are?,
ST_CS_2_11_5_NocosDeath/11_Maelle,Will you… Tell me your name?,
ST_CS_2_11_5_NocosDeath/06_Maelle,[choked sob],
ST_CS_2_11_5_NocosDeath/04_Lune,[gasps],
ST_CS_2_11_5_NocosDeath/07_Maelle,[screams],
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/20_Verso,And all… all for naught.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/44_Lune,"And as Expeditioners, if
we die, we die fighting.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/31_Curator,Axons. Axons.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/06_Verso,"Because it’s private and it’s painful.
And it’s none of your business.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/14_Sciel,"But we’re a team now. And we won’t get
very far if we don’t trust each other.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/16B_Lune,Can you bring Noco back?,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/29B_Lune,"Can you make a weapon that
can pierce the barrier?",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/02_Lune,Care to explain?,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/43_Lune,"Close, but not zero. Death
is coming either way.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/30_Lune,Do you need something from the Axons?,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/32_Lune,Do you need… their hearts?,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/29_Lune,Excuse me.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/22_Lune,"Expedition 58 seemed to
think you knew another way.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/15_Maelle,Family– is complicated.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/13_Sciel,He hasn’t steered us wrong yet.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/39_Verso,"I can’t die and I still
couldn’t take them down.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/07_Verso,I cut ties with him decades ago.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/41_Verso,"I don’t know how that one died but
I’m telling you, listen to me, please",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/04_Verso,I don’t think of him as my father anymore.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/46_Lune,I know.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/11_Sciel,"I think we can all understand where
each other’s coming from. Right?",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/26_Verso,"I wasn’t hiding it, if that’s what
you’re implying. It’s a dead end.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/29A_Lune,Is it true?,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/16A_Lune,Is that true?,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/18_Monoco,It will be– a different Noco.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/10_Lune,"I’d rather make that
determination for myself.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/19_Verso,"I’m– I am so very sorry, my friend.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/09_Verso,I’ve told you everything you need to know–,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/33_Verso,"Look. To create this weapon, he needs
enormous amounts of pure chroma.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/08_Lune,Lying by omission is still lying.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/01_Esquie,Ooooh Dorrie! Thank you mon amie!,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/17_Monoco,Partially.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/25_Verso,So that’s how you–,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/05_Sciel,Still. Why didn’t you just tell us?,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/20A_Verso,"The Paintress’ heart was in
that manor and now it’s gone.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/18A_Monoco,The one you knew is gone.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/35_Verso,"The only source are Axons, yes, but like I
said, that’s a dead end, it’s impossible.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/16_Lune,The stories say that gestrals reincarnate?,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/28_Lune,There is someone else who can help us.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/37_Verso,"They’re massive creatures living
on islands around the Monolith.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/38_Verso,"They’re much stronger and MUCH,
MUCH more dangerous than Nevrons.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/27_Maelle,"Wait, what’re you talking about?",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/17A_Monoco,"We can bring Noco back to life,",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/24_Lune,We found 58 and their journals.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/21_Verso,We have no way to access the Monolith.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/23_Verso,What?,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/34_Verso,"Which is way beyond what
we can get from Nevrons.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/36_Maelle,Why? What are Axons?,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/45_Monoco,Wonderful pep talk.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/40_Lune,"Yet we found the corpse of one
in Old Lumière. So it’s possible.",
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/03_Lune,Your father?,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/17B_Monoco,but not all of Noco will return.,
ST_CS_2_11_6_SoStartsTheAxonHunt/42_Verso,"our chances of taking them down without
you lot dying are close to zero.",
ST_CS_2_11_7_AxonStrategy/01_Verso,"Alright, if– IF– we’re going to fight
the Axons, then let’s be smart about it.",
ST_CS_2_11_7_AxonStrategy/05_Verso,"And we need at least two
hearts to get enough chroma.",
ST_CS_2_11_7_AxonStrategy/13_Verso,Did you listen to what I just said?,
ST_CS_2_11_7_AxonStrategy/08_Verso,"It’s already been weakened by
previous expeditions, alright?",
ST_CS_2_11_7_AxonStrategy/03_Verso,"I’ve had a few rough
encounters with the Axons.",
ST_CS_2_11_7_AxonStrategy/11_Monoco,Mmmm. I like your spirit.,
ST_CS_2_11_7_AxonStrategy/06_Verso,"One lives on a mountain too high
for us to reach, so that one’s out.",
ST_CS_2_11_7_AxonStrategy/10_Sciel,"Or we embrace the challenge
and pick the one in the east!",
ST_CS_2_11_7_AxonStrategy/12_Sciel,Thank you.,
ST_CS_2_11_7_AxonStrategy/04_Verso,"There are three located on
islands around the Monolith.",
ST_CS_2_11_7_AxonStrategy/07_Verso,"We should start with the one
to the west of the Monolith.",
ST_CS_2_11_7_AxonStrategy/02_Sciel,What d’you mean?,
ST_CS_2_11_7_AxonStrategy/09_Lune,"Yeah, good idea. Maximise our chances.",
ST_CS_2_12_1_IntroSirene/07_Monoco,"Be careful. They call her
She Who Plays with Wonder.",
ST_CS_2_12_1_IntroSirene/08_Monoco,"But what she really does
is play with your head.",
ST_CS_2_12_1_IntroSirene/01_Lune,Is she the Axon?,
ST_CS_2_12_1_IntroSirene/03_Lune,It’s so–,
ST_CS_2_12_1_IntroSirene/05_Lune,I– I don’t know–,
ST_CS_2_12_1_IntroSirene/09_Verso,"Let’s move fast, before
we all lose our minds.",
ST_CS_2_12_1_IntroSirene/04_Maelle,Lune? What’s going on?,
ST_CS_2_12_1_IntroSirene/02A_Verso,Putain.,
ST_CS_2_12_1_IntroSirene/06_Monoco,"She’s manipulating your emotions! You
have to focus. Remember why you’re here.",
ST_CS_2_12_1_IntroSirene/02_Monoco,Sirène. She Who Plays With Wonder.,
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/07_Maelle,"Better than battling through
a mountain of Nevrons.",
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/13_MaskKeeper,I assume that’s why you’re here?,
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/06_Maelle,"I don’t mind a
straightforward path for once.",
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/02_Verso,It’s not attacking…,
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/17_MaskKeeper,Look for the masks that you need.,
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/16_MaskKeeper,"Masks are not just to obscure.
They may also illuminate.",
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/18_Maelle,Meaning?,
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/05_Verso,Mm-mm. Feels like a trap.,
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/08_Sciel,"No, Verso’s right. Something feels off.",
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/09_MaskKeeper,"Oh, I’m harmless, you don’t need those.",
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/04_Sciel,So it seems.,
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/19_MaskKeeper,The invitation stands.,
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/11_MaskKeeper,Touché.,
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/03_Maelle,Was that an invitation?,
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/10_Verso,"Well if you’re harmless, then these
weapons will stay harmless too.",
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/20_Sciel,"Well. Head straight to the
Axon or take the other paths?",
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/12_MaskKeeper,"Well. Visages invites you to join him
in his chamber at the end of this path.",
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/01_Sciel,What’s it doing?,
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/14_Sciel,Where do the other paths lead?,
ST_CS_2_14_1_TheCentralPlazaOfVisages/15_MaskKeeper,You’re free to traverse them.,
ST_CS_2_14_2_Visages/01_Verso,I think you pissed him off.,
ST_CS_2_14_3_VisagesMidbattle/06_MaskKeeper,"Child, we all need masks,
but how you use them, mmm.",
ST_CS_2_14_3_VisagesMidbattle/02_MaskKeeper,"Front, back. Recto, verso.",
ST_CS_2_14_3_VisagesMidbattle/03_MaskKeeper,"Great art is both window and mirror.
Whether it’s your mask or theirs.",
ST_CS_2_14_3_VisagesMidbattle/04_Verso,"Harmless, huh.",
ST_CS_2_14_3_VisagesMidbattle/05_Sciel,He’s the real Axon.,
ST_CS_2_14_3_VisagesMidbattle/07_Maelle,Merde.,
ST_CS_2_14_3_VisagesMidbattle/01_MaskKeeper,"People want so badly to know.
“What’s behind the mask?”",
ST_CS_2_14_4_TheEndOfVisages/06_Sciel,"Axon down. Let’s bring
this to the Curator.",
ST_CS_2_14_4_TheEndOfVisages/04A_Sciel,Because it is me.,
ST_CS_2_14_4_TheEndOfVisages/02_Sciel,"No, wait–",
ST_CS_2_14_4_TheEndOfVisages/08_Verso,Renoir?,
ST_CS_2_14_4_TheEndOfVisages/07_Verso,"That was Verso, wasn’t it?",
ST_CS_2_14_4_TheEndOfVisages/04_Sciel,This mask can’t hurt me.,
ST_CS_2_14_4_TheEndOfVisages/03_MaskKeeper,We all need masks–,
ST_CS_2_14_4_TheEndOfVisages/01_Maelle,We did it!,
ST_CS_2_14_4_TheEndOfVisages/05A_Verso,What happened?,
ST_CS_2_14_4_TheEndOfVisages/05_Verso,You okay?,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/13_Maelle,Are you ready?,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/10_Maelle,Can you play another?,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/07_Verso,Do you mind if I play here?,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/15_Verso,Esquie? You ready?,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/06A_Verso,He can be quite traumatising.,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/14_Verso,"I am ready, I will need
a bit of space. Alright.",
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/08A_Maelle,I feel like I know it.,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/05_Maelle,I saw– I saw… It was…,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/06_Verso,I used to see him in my nightmares too.,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/01_Maelle,Me?,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/12_Verso,"Okay, ready?",
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/05A_Maelle,Renoir?,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/11_Verso,"Sure, we uh, we have all night.",
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/03_Maelle,That was– I saw–,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/04_Sciel,What happened?,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/08_Maelle,What song was that?,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/02_Lune,Why?,
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/09_Verso,"Yeah, it’s an old song I
used to play to my sister.",
ST_CS_2_15_1_CampAfterFirstAxon/01A_Maelle,You want me to give it to you?,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/49_Display,A Life to Dream,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/10_Lune,And finally break this cycle.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/47_VersoRenoir,Between the bars of their prison.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/39_MirrorRenoir,"But are you willing to let
THEM pay the price for YOU?",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/30_MirrorRenoir,"But my son,",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/24_Maelle,Do you have apple juice?,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/31_MirrorRenoir,Have you thought through the consequences?,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/22_Maelle,I don’t know how you can like this.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/19_Verso,"I don’t normally share, but I suppose
tonight deserves an exception.",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/18_Verso,"I stored my personal stash inside
him. All excellent vintages.",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/20A_Esquie,I told you to stop drinking alone.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/44_Verso,In the shadow of the Monolith.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/45_MirrorRenoir,In the shadow of the Monolith.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/48_VersoRenoir,"In the shadow of the Monolith.
In the shadow of the Monolith.",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/01_Maelle,Is it… You again?,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/23_Lune,It comes with age.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/05_Maelle,I– I don’t know. A– A woman. It was–,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/29_MirrorRenoir,I’m not here to fight.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/16_Esquie,"I’m sorry, Verso!",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/03_Verso,Maelle?,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/46_VersoRenoir,"May everything be decided
before their very eyes.",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/20_Esquie,"Mon ami,",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/26_Verso,"My beautiful sister doesn’t
need this ugly mask.",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/14_Sciel,"Nobody ever wondered what
Esquie was made of, did they?",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/32_MirrorRenoir,"Not just for you, or
even me, but for them.",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/16A_Esquie,She promised me sweet rocks!,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/37_MirrorRenoir,"Sometimes, we paint the
bars of our own prison.",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/11_Sciel,"That being said… Someone here has
been hiding a terrible secret from us.",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/33_MirrorRenoir,"Their memories, their dreams,
their love for each other?",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/21_Sciel,To your great generosity.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/35_MirrorRenoir,"We exist and we will exist
for as long as she wants.",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/15_Sciel,"Well, Esquie and I had a chat.",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/09_Maelle,We’re really going to face the Paintress.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/08_Sciel,We’ve done it.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/12_Lune,What are you talking about?,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/04_Lune,What did you see this time?,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/17_Lune,What! Is that wine?,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/50_Display,When the choice comes.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/06_Maelle,Who are you?,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/02_Maelle,Who are–,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/34_MirrorRenoir,"Who really is the one painting
death? And who paints life instead?",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/05A_Maelle,Why do I keep seeing things?,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/25_Verso,"Yeah, I’ll, uh, I’ll leave you to it.",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/28_Verso,You brought him here?!,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/27_MirrorRenoir,"You embrace her, yet you’re
condemning her to die.",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/38_MirrorRenoir,You think you’re ready to pay the price.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/13_Sciel,"You thought we’d never
find out, didn’t you?",
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/36_MirrorRenoir,You want to spoil what we’ve been given.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/37A_MirrorRenoir,Your despair blinds you.,
ST_CS_2_15_2_CampAfterSecondAxon/30A_MirrorRenoir,"do you know what it means to
disappear into nothingness?",
ST_CS_2_15_4_BreakingTheBarrier/01_Lune,"Maelle, you should do the honours.",
ST_CS_2_15_4_BreakingTheBarrier/02_Maelle,[screams],
ST_CS_2_15_5_TheBarrierStands/04_Verso,Axons first.,
ST_CS_2_15_5_TheBarrierStands/05_Verso,"It’s ok, you’ll be fine.",
ST_CS_2_15_5_TheBarrierStands/08_Lune,I’m okay.,
ST_CS_2_15_5_TheBarrierStands/03_Verso,I’m telling you we can’t.,
ST_CS_2_15_5_TheBarrierStands/09_Verso,Okay.,
ST_CS_2_15_5_TheBarrierStands/01_Lune,"This looks similar to Lumière’s shield
dome. Maybe we can just cross it.",
ST_CS_2_15_5_TheBarrierStands/02_Verso,Yeah sure.,
ST_CS_2_15_5_TheBarrierStands/07_Verso,You wanna try again?,
ST_CS_2_15_5_TheBarrierStands/06_Lune,[annoyed tsk],
ST_CS_2_16_1_MeetingThePaintress/02_Maelle,For Gustave.,
ST_CS_2_16_1_MeetingThePaintress/03_Lune,For all of them.,
ST_CS_2_16_1_MeetingThePaintress/01_Maelle,We can– We can do this.,
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/14_Lune,Everybody okay?,
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/15_Verso,Follow her. Quickly.,
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/06_Maelle,I don’t think this is the–,
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/02_Verso,"I don’t understand, the
Gradient Attacks should work–",
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/12_Verso,Maelle!,
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/08_Lune,"Maelle, careful.",
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/07_Verso,"No, nononono.",
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/19_Lune,Ok.,
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/01_Lune,Our attacks do nothing!,
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/17_Verso,This might be our only chance.,
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/03_Verso,"Wait, Maelle.",
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/16_Lune,What?,
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/18_Lune,Yeah.,
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/11_Maelle,[panicked scream],
ST_CS_2_16_3_GoingInsideTheMonolith/13_Maelle,[strangled scream],
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/09_MirrorRenoir,But you’re not.,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/14_Verso,Family is… complicated.,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/11A_MirrorRenoir,"How are you different
from her in doing this?",
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/07_MirrorRenoir,I refuse to lose my son.,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/12_Verso,I'm tired.,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/15_MirrorRenoir,"If saving you means losing you,",
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/01_Maelle,Is that–,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/06_MirrorRenoir,"Punishment, perhaps, for not
being there when it mattered.",
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/04_MirrorRenoir,She’s not the only one who grieves.,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/13_MirrorRenoir,So trust me.,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/11_MirrorRenoir,So you leave us no choice?,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/08_Verso,That son was a stranger.,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/05_MirrorRenoir,"The pain of losing you…
She made me inherit it.",
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/13A_MirrorRenoir,We are your family.,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/16_Verso,We only need to incapacitate him.,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/17_Maelle,We’ll find a way to kill him.,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/03_Verso,We’re taking her down.,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/10_Verso,You lost me years ago. And I lost you.,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/09A_MirrorRenoir,You're not.,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/02_Maelle,You…,
ST_CS_2_17_2_FinalFightWithMirrorRenoir/15A_MirrorRenoir,then so be it.,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/10_MirrorRenoir,"At long last, we meet.",
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/22_Lune,"Behind this door
is the future of Lumière.",
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/17_Lune,Can you do it again?,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/11A_MirrorRenoir,Destroying it won’t bring your wife back.,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/15_Lune,Hey. How did you do that?,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/18_Maelle,"I don’t know– uh, I think
so? Yeah, yeah I think I can.",
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/24_Lune,I have trust… in us.,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/13_MirrorRenoir,I love them too.,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/16_Maelle,I'm not sure. The Curator– I felt it–,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/12_MirrorRenoir,"It will only destroy the last
tie you have to each other.",
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/04A_MirrorRenoir,"It’s not her. It’s your
sister. Your mother. Me.",
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/20_Verso,I’m… I’m not sure.,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/04_MirrorRenoir,Remember who your REAL family is.,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/21_Maelle,She’s through there.,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/19A_Sciel,The things he said to the Curator.,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/09_MirrorRenoir,"Then let us celebrate the second
destruction of the Dessendre family.",
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/11_MirrorRenoir,This is all you have left of your son.,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/05_MirrorRenoir,"WE are your family. You would
condemn us all to die, for what?",
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/14_Maelle,We did it Gustave–,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/19_Sciel,What did Renoir mean?,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/23_Lune,What every expedition has worked towards.,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/06_MirrorRenoir,"Who do you really save
with your sacrifice?",
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/22A_Lune,Yeah…,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/07_Maelle,Your sister. And… your mother…,
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/08_Verso,"You’re too drunk on your
own illusions to understand.",
ST_CS_2_17_3_TheEndOfMirrorRenoir/01_MirrorRenoir,[pained roar],
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/07_Lune,Alicia?,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/10_Lune,Alicia’s your daughter.,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/06C_Aline,Alicia…,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/11_Sciel,And Maelle reminds you of her.,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/09A_Maelle,Are you going to burn it again?,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/06_Aline,Are you really here?,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/05_Aline,But the fire–,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/12_Aline,Come along.,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/12A_Aline,Let’s go home.,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/09_Maelle,My face? What about my face?,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/15_Verso,"No, Verso’s dead.",
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/16_Aline,"No, no, you are HIS creations, not mine.",
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/06B_Aline,Oh… is he playing tricks again?,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/06A_Aline,Or is He–?,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/03_Lune,"Renoir. He mentioned the Curator’s
wife. She’s the Paintress?",
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/02_Sciel,She looks like the Curator.,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/14A_Aline,She’s not Alicia.,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/01_Maelle,That’s her. The Paintress.,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/11A_Sciel,The daughter you lost.,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/14_Aline,This is another trick.,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/17_Verso,"This is what we created
the expeditions for.",
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/18_Lune,Tomorrow comes.,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/13_Verso,Yes. You need to go home.,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/14B_Aline,You are not my Verso.,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/16A_Aline,You will not take this Canvas from me!,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/08_Aline,Your face–,
ST_CS_2_18_1_ThePaintress/04_Aline,You’ve come– back–,
ST_CS_2_18_2_PaintressTransitionToPhase2/02_Verso,Esquie!,
ST_CS_2_18_2_PaintressTransitionToPhase2/05A_Lune,Let's go.,
ST_CS_2_18_2_PaintressTransitionToPhase2/03_Verso,Look what I found.,
ST_CS_2_18_2_PaintressTransitionToPhase2/01A_Lune,Maelle.,
ST_CS_2_18_2_PaintressTransitionToPhase2/01_Verso,Merde! I don't like this.,
ST_CS_2_18_2_PaintressTransitionToPhase2/04_Esquie,Oooooh SOARRIE!,
ST_CS_2_18_2_PaintressTransitionToPhase2/05_Esquie,Whooooohooo! All aboard!,
ST_CS_2_18_3_PaintressTransitionToPhase3/01_Maelle,Is it over?,
ST_CS_2_18_3_PaintressTransitionToPhase3/02_Verso,"No, we’re not done yet.",
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/03_Aline,Alicia.,
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/10_Sciel,"And I’m pretty sure Gustave’s
watching over us. Hey, come–",
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/08_Maelle,Is this real?,
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/06_Monoco,It’s done.,
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/13_Sciel,It’s symbolic!,
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/04_Sciel,It’s… over. The number–,
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/14_Maelle,Let’s… let's go home.,
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/02_Verso,Rest now. Things’ll be better soon.,
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/05A_Lune,She’s gone!,
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/05_Lune,She’s gone.,
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/12_Lune,"Though presumably, there will
be no one coming after right?",
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/11_Sciel,Wanna plant it?,
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/01_Aline,Why?,
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/09_Sciel,Yeah…,
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/15_Sciel,Yeah…,
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/07_Monoco,You are all free.,
ST_CS_2_18_4_TheEndOfThePaintress/06A_Monoco,You’re free.,
ST_CS_2_19_1_FlyBackToLumiere/11A_Lune,But we’re not done yet.,
ST_CS_2_19_1_FlyBackToLumiere/10_Sciel,"Guess this is how it feels to be immortal.
What do we do now with all this time?",
ST_CS_2_19_1_FlyBackToLumiere/06_Monoco,Have I.,
ST_CS_2_19_1_FlyBackToLumiere/04_Verso,I appreciate the offer.,
ST_CS_2_19_1_FlyBackToLumiere/14_Esquie,LUMIÈRE… LUMIÈRE AHEAD! OOOH!,
ST_CS_2_19_1_FlyBackToLumiere/05_Sciel,"Monoco. You’ve been extra quiet
since we got to the Monolith.",
ST_CS_2_19_1_FlyBackToLumiere/02_Verso,No less than yesterday.,
ST_CS_2_19_1_FlyBackToLumiere/03_Sciel,Shall we test it out?,
ST_CS_2_19_1_FlyBackToLumiere/01_Sciel,Still feel immortal?,
ST_CS_2_19_1_FlyBackToLumiere/11_Lune,The Expedition might be over…,
ST_CS_2_19_1_FlyBackToLumiere/12_Lune,There are many questions left to answer.,
ST_CS_2_19_1_FlyBackToLumiere/08_Maelle,"We go back to Lumière, and… life goes on?",
ST_CS_2_19_1_FlyBackToLumiere/07_Maelle,What now?,
ST_CS_2_19_1_FlyBackToLumiere/09_Sciel,Yeah. Decades and decades in front of us.,
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new09_MirrorAlicia,Alicia - as she was meant to be.,
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new28_MirrorAlicia,Alicia.,
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new01_MirrorAlicia,"Brother,",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new24_MirrorAlicia,"But perhaps you’ll find another
way. You who have lived amongst us.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new18_MirrorAlicia,For he does love her.,
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new15_MirrorAlicia,For in ridding the world of the Paintress…,
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new02_MirrorAlicia,"I tire of the conflicts and deceptions
that plague our family and theirs.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new07_MirrorAlicia,"It’s a strange feeling, watching you
with my brother. Laughing and smiling.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new04_MirrorAlicia,I’m at peace with what’s to come.,
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new06_MirrorAlicia,"Maelle,",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new11_MirrorAlicia,"My family, a facsimile of
yours. And this world, a mirror.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new10_MirrorAlicia,Not this painted version that I am.,
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new21_MirrorAlicia,"Of the few she can save
as her power wanes.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new20_MirrorAlicia,"On her Monolith, she paints
a warning for us all.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new12_MirrorAlicia,"Painted by your mother, the
Paintress, to stave off her grief.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new25_MirrorAlicia,"Perhaps you differ from your father
and your sister, as I differ from mine.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new14_MirrorAlicia,"Seeing your expedition through
would plunge us all into the abyss.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new03_MirrorAlicia,"So I entrust you with this letter.
Whether you give it to her is up to you.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new17_MirrorAlicia,"The one who invokes the flowers
of the Gommage. An act of love.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new22_MirrorAlicia,We all wish for our families to thrive.,
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new29_MirrorAlicia,What will you paint?,
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new05_MirrorAlicia,"When the time comes, I
hope you will be too.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new27_MirrorAlicia,"Whilst your father, death.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new08_MirrorAlicia,"Without the scars or the
memories that afflict me.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new19_MirrorAlicia,Your Father.,
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new23_MirrorAlicia,"Your family, however,
believes only one can survive.",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new26_MirrorAlicia,"Your mother paints life,",
ST_CS_2_19_2_TheFinalGommage/new16_MirrorAlicia,"You’d lose the sole force standing
against the one who would erase us.",
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/07_Verso,All we can do is carry them with us.,
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/17_Maelle,"But Gustave and the others… They
really want to change things.",
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/19_Verso,"Can’t always shoulder the
world’s problems, you know?",
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/18_Verso,Changing your life also counts.,
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/10_Verso,Drowning in our own sadness?,
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/16_Maelle,Escape. Yeah. That’s what I wanted.,
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/02_Verso,Glad you liked it.,
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/21_Maelle,"Gustave would probably
say, if more of us cared,",
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/23_Verso,He sounds like a good guy.,
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/11_Verso,Hey. Why did you join the Expedition?,
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/28_Verso,"I gotta say, I didn’t take you
for an “official” kind of person.",
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/08_Maelle,I guess.,
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/25_Maelle,I kept Gustave’s.,
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/11A_Verso,"I mean, with the Gommage– I understand
the rest of the team’s decision,",
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/01A_Maelle,It really was a beautiful place.,
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/15_Verso,"It’s natural, wanting to
escape a life you don’t want.",
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/03_Verso,I’ve buried friends there too.,
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/06_Maelle,No.,
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/13_Maelle,"Out here seemed better
than in there. At the time.",
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/26_Maelle,So you can have mine.,
ST_CS_2_9_10_MaelleAndVersoBond/09_Maelle,Sorry. It’s just– We’re…,

the load for everyone.",

destroyed by that MAN, but",
ST_CS_2_9_1_MourningGustave/29_Verso,And we’re not affected by the Gommage.,
ST_CS_2_9_1_MourningGustave/18_Sciel,"And where did you get
that expedition uniform?",
ST_CS_2_9_1_MourningGustave/36_Lune,And you don’t?,
ST_CS_2_9_1_MourningGustave/37_Verso,"Burying everyone you know while you
live on… Can wear you down a bit.",
ST_CS_2_9_1_MourningGustave/26A_Lune,But how are you alive? And not–,
ST_CS_2_9_1_MourningGustave/06A_Lune,But we lost the Lumina Converter–,

but perhaps I can help you.",
ST_CS_2_9_1_MourningGustave/28_Verso,"I don’t know how, exactly,
but some of us stopped ageing.",

best path is through the quarry up north.",

ST_CS_2_9_1_MourningGustave/03_Sciel,"Seems like everytime we’re
together, it’s to grieve.",

have to kill the Paintress first.",
ST_CS_2_9_1_MourningGustave/19_Verso,Strange way to say thank you.,

the Monolith. We keep heading north.",
ST_CS_2_9_1_MourningGustave/15_Verso,This seemed important.,

cross before nightfall.",

ST_CS_2_9_8_RipGustave/05_Sciel,You were always there for me.,

ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/21_Lune,Alright then.,
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/20A_Verso,And I don’t know much more.,
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/22_Lune,And then we’ll take the Paintress’ heart.,
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/17_Lune,"Before the Fracture, our Lumière was
part of a larger city on the continent.",

in the centre of Old Lumière.",

then it’s going to take a few hours,",
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/12_Lune,"Ok. So where is this heart?
What does it look like?",
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/16_Lune,So it’s true.,
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/13A_Verso,That I don’t know.,
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/10_Verso,"The Chroma there is far too dense,
it erases anyone who gets close.",
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/06_Verso,"To recruit my oldest friend.
We’ll need the extra firepower,",
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/13_Verso,What it looks like?,
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/05_Lune,Why there?,
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/15A_Verso,Yes.,
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/09_Verso,"Yes. You can’t just stroll
up to the Paintress.",
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/15_Sciel,You found Old Lumière?,
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/03_Verso,"and then we make a stop, we get some
rest and some food and then from there,",
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/07_Verso,"because our next goal will be to
take down the Paintress’ heart.",
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/11A_Verso,the barrier will fall.,
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/04_Verso,we head north to Monoco’s Station.,
ST_CS_2_9_9_OnwardToMonocosStation/01_Verso,"…for about two hours then there’s a big
lake. We shouldn’t go there. At all.",

ST_CS_3_20_0B_AliciaAtelier/02_Clea,Our little shadow is awake.,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/35_LumiereMother,And her name will be…,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/06_Clea,"And that means stopping the final
sliver of Verso’s soul from painting.",
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/29_LumiereMother,And you will learn.,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/31_LumiereMother,And you’ll shine as their guiding light.,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/13_Clea,"At least this will keep you out
of trouble until I get back.",
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/26_LumiereMother,Because we live in an unforgiving world.,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/27_LumiereMother,But you are strong and you will survive.,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/10_Clea,"Calm, Alicia, or it’ll paint over you–",
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/32_LumiereMother,"For you will change the world
and the people around you.",
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/34_LumiereMother,I have decided on her name.,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/20_LumiereMother,I want you to know… you’re not alone.,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/01_RealAlicia,"If we bring Maman out of the
Canvas, she’ll try to return.",

ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/18_LumiereMother,"Oh, my darling girl. We have
precious little time together.",
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/14_LumiereFather,"Oh, she’s a girl… She’s a girl!",
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/07_Clea,"See, that wasn’t so hard.",
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/04_Clea,"She’ll still find it, but… I’m impressed.",
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/15_LumiereFather,"She’s beautiful. What…
What a lovely voice.",
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/09_Clea,"Stay calm, don’t let
it take control of you.",
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/05_Clea,"This only truly ends if
you destroy the Canvas.",
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/08_Clea,Wait– that’s Aline’s chroma.,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/02_RealAlicia,We must hide the Canvas…,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/03_Clea,"Well-reasoned. And such a…
clever hiding spot you’ve chosen.",
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/12_Clea,"Well. You’re about to be reborn in this
world as one of Aline’s creations. Have fun.",
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/11_Clea,What an auspicious start.,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/17_LumiereMother,Yes.,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/21_LumiereMother,"You will always be the beautiful
child I held in my arms.",
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/23_LumiereMother,You will cry iridescent tears.,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/25_LumiereMother,You will know loss all too well.,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/24_LumiereMother,You will know love and you will know pain.,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/22_LumiereMother,You will smile the brightest smile.,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/28_LumiereMother,You will struggle…,
ST_CS_3_20_0C_AliciaBirth/30_LumiereMother,You’ll find people to call your own.,

you to know that you are loved.",
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/02_Maelle,"Actually, I prefer “Maelle”.",
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/01_Verso,Alicia?,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/21_Maelle,"Better for who? Verso would have
never wanted his Canvas gone.",
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/19_Maelle,But I’m glad you exist.,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/04_Verso,"But I’m not really Verso, and
you’re not really Maelle, are you?",
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/17_Maelle,Giving you his memories.,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/22_Maelle,"He loved Esquie and his
Gestrals and Grandis.",
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/29_Maelle,He’s much warmer than the Renoir you know.,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/30_Verso,I bet.,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/03_Verso,I think I do too.,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/13_Maelle,"If I hadn’t trusted the Writers,
Verso would still be alive, and you–",
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/12_Maelle,If I’d listened to Maman–,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/23_Verso,"It was killing my… our mother,",
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/25_Maelle,"It’s not make-believe.
It’s not… You’re not…",
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/11_Maelle,I’m sorry too.,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/10_Verso,I’m sorry.,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/07_Maelle,I’m still Maelle though.,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/16_Maelle,"Maman did a terrible thing,
painting you into Verso’s Canvas.",
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/28_Maelle,"Maman painted a rather
unflattering portrait of him.",
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/26_Maelle,Papa’s here. He’ll help me fix Lumière.,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/18_Maelle,Pretending the fire only took me.,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/25A_Maelle,To me…,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/27_Verso,Will he.,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/15_Maelle,Wouldn’t be caught in the middle.,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/14_Verso,Wouldn’t exist.,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/09_Verso,Yeah I… I wanted to– but I…,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/06_Maelle,"You look and sound just
like him. But you’re you.",
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/08_Maelle,You should’ve helped me remember.,
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/20_Verso,"Your father was right to erase
everyone. It’s better this way.",
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/05_Maelle,"You’re not Verso, no.",
ST_CS_3_20_1_RedAndWhiteTree/24_Verso,"staying here so long in a make-believe

we won’t have to worry anymore.",

to lose myself if I stay!",
ST_CS_3_20_2_MeetingRealRenoir/12_RealRenoir,"I’m proud of you. Getting your mother
out of the Canvas was not easy.",

letting my daughter risk her life.",
ST_CS_3_20_2_MeetingRealRenoir/39_Esquie,Mes amis!,

This is our only opportunity,",
ST_CS_3_20_2_MeetingRealRenoir/05_RealRenoir,Some of Aline’s finest work.,
ST_CS_3_20_2_MeetingRealRenoir/04_Maelle,Technically my body’s at home.,

You can’t just decide–",

to you most of all.",

piece of him that we have.",

outcome we both desire.",

ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/30_Maelle,"Hmm. It’s old chroma, not pure.",
ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/13_Lune,How did we–,
ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/31_Maelle,"It won’t be like bringing the two of you
back, but… we could use it in other ways.",
ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/25_Maelle,"I– Yeah. But I need chroma. And Papa
controls all the chroma in the Canvas.",
ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/15_Lune,Maelle… Your hair?,
ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/26_Lune,No.,

ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/05_Verso,"Painting isn’t about
verisimilitude. It’s about essence.",
ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/01_Maelle,Papa did it so easily.,
ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/04_Verso,Remember them.,
ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/04A_Verso,Remember who they are.,

mother. And… your brother.",

ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/15A_Maelle,We have much to talk about.,
ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/22_Lune,We trusted you and you–,
ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/01A_Maelle,What am I doing wrong?,
ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/11_Lune,What-,
ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/24_Sciel,"You can bring them back too, yeah?",
ST_CS_3_20_3_ThePlanToCounterattack/20_Lune,You fucking coward. You betrayed us.,

can never take back.",
ST_CS_3_21_2_FacingRenoir/25_RealRenoir,"As your father, I must look out for you.",

ST_CS_3_21_2_FacingRenoir/23_RealRenoir,But this is not the way.,
ST_CS_3_21_2_FacingRenoir/17_Lune,"But ultimately, the voices in
their head have to be their own.",

what this Canvas means to me–",
ST_CS_3_21_2_FacingRenoir/04A_RealRenoir,"I know how powerful
and intoxicating it is,",

ST_CS_3_21_2_FacingRenoir/01_Maelle,Papa.,
ST_CS_3_21_2_FacingRenoir/03_Maelle,Please.,
ST_CS_3_21_2_FacingRenoir/07_Maelle,"That doesn’t mean you have
to erase Verso’s Canvas!",
ST_CS_3_21_2_FacingRenoir/16_Lune,"The choices of parents leave
indelible marks upon their children.",

a choice I must make.",

defeated it no problem.",

have done that blindfolded.",

mean you can be in two places at once?",

ST_CS_SC_03_1_MagicVerso/30_Verso,"Well, yeah you see, I can go
hunt Nevrons with my top half,",

ST_CS_SC_03_1_MagicVerso/34_Verso,"Yeah, my hair is…",
ST_CS_SC_03_1_MagicVerso/05_Verso,"Yeah. They lost a lot of friends, and they
just buried another. Grieving takes time.",

a lot of people out of my life.",

ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_14,Aline would rather lose herself in make-believe than face reality.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_Frame_NotStarted_01,An empty canvas…,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_03,"And I certainly didn't expect the doppelganger to pull you into his schemes. He was supposed to keep an eye on you, not recruit you.",
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_16,And Renoir… he's terrified of losing more family.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_10,"And before you call me a hypocrite, yes, I did get involved.",
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_17,And his response is to try to bend everyone to his will. Don't let his fear end up controlling you.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_11,"And if you insist on staying too, well, that's your choice.",
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_23,And if you're not having fun… do something else.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_08,And spare me that drivel of how much this Canvas means to you. I've spent far more time here than you.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_08,"But instead, they do… this. And pull others into their mess.",
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_12,But there's a difference between helping and getting sucked in.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_04,But you did well. All that's left is for Renoir to clean up the Canvas.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_12,But. Renoir will not stand for it. And I need him to help me with the real conflict outside. Not waste more of his time in here.,

ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_26,"Come on Alicia, have some fun.",
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_02,Did you have fun?,

ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_30,"Don't you, Alicia?",
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_13,Enough. I grow tired repeating myself. Renoir will do what needs to be done. Why don't we have some fun instead?,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_29,Every Canvas has its own rules. And I find death a boring outcome.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective1_04,From my past experiments.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_16,"Good, I'll show you what you missed out on, all those years hiding in your room.",
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_03,Good. It's about time.,

ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_22,"I believe your friends call them ""Nevrons.""",
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_14,I could use some fun.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_02,I didn't expect you and… your friends to succeed.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_11,"I gave Renoir the edge he needed. Otherwise she would have overpowered him long ago. She is, after all, the stronger Painter.",
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_End_01,I hope you had fun. Just remember…,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_09,I painted half this world with Verso. We went on adventures here while you sat reading in your room.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_10,I was perfectly fine leaving Maman here to work out her sorrows.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_21,"I've sketched some figures. Doodles, really.",
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_23,"It's a creative name, I like it.",
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_15,It's a drug she's unwilling to resist. Don't make the same mistake.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_17,It's a game Verso and I used to play.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_18,"It's not selfish to make your own choices, sister.",
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective1_05,Let's see how far you've come.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective1_02,Let's see how you do against a proper drawing.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_09,Like you. Trapped in Aline's delusion.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_06,Neither of them are adult enough for the conversation they need to have.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_05,"No, we won't let him.",
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_01,Not bad. I'm impressed.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_20,"Play, don't play, I don't care. I'll explain the rules, then, do as you want.",

ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_21,Take this.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_15,That sounds suspicious.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_27,The Gauntlet lies within this Canvas.,
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_End_02,"The only thing you owe them, is to live a life you enjoy.",
ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_Objective2_13,This is not your battle. Don't let their mess become yours.,

ST_D_CleasTower/ST_D_CleasTower_SpiritClea_18,"[sigh] Still such a timid child. You mope around all day, sad that you have no friends to play with.",
ST_D_CleasWorkshop/ST_D_CleasWorkshop_FacelessBoy_Path1_10,A curious yet admirable pursuit.,
ST_D_CleasWorkshop/ST_D_CleasWorkshop_FacelessBoy_Path3_01,"A lost soul, adrift in twilight.",
ST_D_CleasWorkshop/ST_D_CleasWorkshop_FacelessBoy_Path2_01,"A sister's brush, a stroke of fear.",
ST_D_CleasWorkshop/ST_D_CleasWorkshop_BeastStatue_01,A statue of a beast.,

ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_End_04,Golgra has destroyed the arena and the Gestral pots.,
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Golgra_Defeat_07,Golgra was quite miffed that someone started a secret arena.,

ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Round1_21,Please don't tell Golgra.,
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Golgra_Defeat_08,Poor Gestral pots.,
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Golgra_14,"Run away like a coward, sounds nice.",
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Golgra_05,She's here! Golgra! She found us! I can sense her muscles from here!,

ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Golgra_Victory_03,This arena will survive. For now.,
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Golgra_06,This has to be the 17th arena I've stumbled upon in the last thirty days.,

ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Golgra_Defeat_05,"We can't, we're in pots!",
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Golgra_09,"We finally have the space for a proper duel, so I won't hold back. I hope you're prepared for what you're asking for.",
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Round1_07,We're doomed.,
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Round1_10,We've been tricked.,
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Round1_20,Welcome to our own private Arena. The Arena in the Gestral Village was boring so we created our own.,
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Round3_05,"Well, looks like you beat all our challenges.",
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Golgra_04,What is it?,
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Golgra_01,"With the strength of a meteor, Golgra lands with a smash inside the arena.",
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Golgra_01,"With this, you'll be even more unstoppable.",
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Round3_02,"Yeah, it's scary.",

ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Round2_04,You lost?! Where's your parent??,
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Pots_Round1_23,You're running an arena from inside your pots?,
ST_D_DarkGestralArena/ST_D_DarkGestralArena_Golgra_03,You…?!,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_20,A ghastly creature…,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_12,A spirit could be defined as…,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_09,A spirit?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_26,Am I feared? Do I look scary?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_29,Another concept that eludes me…,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_08,Are you a spirit?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro2_03,Are you perhaps… explorers of some sort? Is this why you sought out this place?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_05,Are you talking about these wood boards?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_End_06,"As I said, I am not familiar with this term.",
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_27,"As long as you don’t look like a Nevron, you’re fine.",
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_End_12,Being defined as Nevron feels right.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro2_09,"Beyond the cliff, something is… resonating.",
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_06,But I fear… they were the ones who cut me off.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_04,Come closer. Please.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_04,Condemned?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_11,Could you enlighten me?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_17,Did I die? Since my duty is unknown to me…,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_06,Do you not see! I am exposed…,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_End_14,Fine then. Try it!,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_End_07,For what reason do you call me a Nevron?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_End_11,"Fortunately, I don’t think I am what you call a spirit anymore.",
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_08,Give these to me.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_End_05,Goodbye. Let our path never cross again.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_23,"Hey, don’t worry, you can’t be any worse than Nevrons.",
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_End_10,I am now defined by my duty.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_07,I am vulnerable in this state… Will you be the one to deal the final blow?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro2_11,I feel… the answer is near.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_07,"I have not the means to protect this frail core, so please.",
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro2_01,I must ask…,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_End_09,I see…,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_End_01,I thank you.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro2_06,I yearn for something.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro2_10,In the hopes of remembering the path I must walk…,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_03,"In this state, I am nothing but condemned.",
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_01,It rings. Something beckons to me…,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro2_04,It’s a complicated story.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_16,I’m coming back to life.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro2_08,I… do not yet know.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_25,Mmm… fear.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_01,My being… A core…,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_15,My duty renewed.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_End_02,My form is now complete… and my duty restored along with it.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_28,Nevrons?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_17,Nobody can touch me now.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_22,Nothing about my existence is human…,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_11,No—,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_18,"Pardon me… I may not know the answer to your question, as I do not know the nature of my state.",
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro2_05,Please listen.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_End_04,So you were a Nevron!,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_02,"So, you have it! It was this material…",
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_16,Someone… that is dead?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_09,Sure. [Give {questItem}],
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_24,The shake in your tone somehow makes it very amusing to hear.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_10,This concept is unfamiliar to me.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_14,This is good.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_19,Weren’t you killed by Nevrons?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro2_02,Who are you?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_03,Will this work?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_02,With the form of a damned soul…,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro2_07,Yearn for what?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_05,"Yes… Condemned to wander aimlessly, as I have been separated from my companions…",
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_21,Yes… that may be correct.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_End_08,"You kill humans, trapping their Chroma.",
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_End_03,You must die.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_10,You seem awfully keen for a pile of planks. I refuse.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_End_13,You would just say adieu to your lives?,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_12,You’re…,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_14,…a made-up ghastly creature to scare kids.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Objective_13,…condemning me.,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_15,…s-something you find very scary…,
ST_D_DoorMaze/ST_D_DoorMaze_Portier_Intro1_13,…the wandering soul of a dead person.,
ST_D_EsquieNest/ST_D_EsquieNest_François_02,"Esquie's gone? Great! Now, all of you can LEAVE ME ALONE.",
ST_D_EsquieNest/ST_D_EsquieNest_Esquie_01,"Fantastic! Good luck mes amis. Please, bring Florrie back to me.",
ST_D_EsquieNest/ST_D_EsquieNest_François_01,"Hmph, you can give him back his stinking stone, I don't care. Now SCRAM!",
ST_D_EsquieNest/ST_D_EsquieNest_Sentry_04,Humans are so rude… more so than Gestrals… which is really saying something…,
ST_D_EsquieNest/ST_D_EsquieNest_Sentry_01,"Oh hi little humans, you need the password to enter.",
ST_D_EsquieNest/ST_D_EsquieNest_Sentry_02,Why?,
ST_D_EsquieNest/ST_D_EsquieNest_Sentry_03,You’ll have to ask Golgra! I just stand here. Golgra never tells me anything.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_17,And why am I unable to do the same?,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_23,Are you sure? Why not find a new purpose?,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_08,Duty.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_06,Each amongst my kind has chosen a weapon from amongst those three.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_27,Ending this existence… is… my new purpose.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_21,Expeditioner. Kill me.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Intro_07,Find me inside the building.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_25,Here. A token of my eternal gratitude.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_16,How do the others fight so effortlessly? With such abandon?,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_24,"I thank you, Expeditioner.",
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Intro_08,I will be waiting.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_20,I wish to end my life while I am still the one controlling it.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_15,I've pondered this again and again.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_29,"If you will not aid me, then please go.",
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_11,In which I was the subject…,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Intro_06,It is settled.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_28,It is the only fight I truly hunger for.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_22,I… understand. Alright. I'll do as you wish.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_14,Maybe…,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_04,My kind knows only battle.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_13,"Something fleeting, I almost recognized it. Is that what my brethren feel? No…",
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Intro_01,Tell me.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_26,Thank you.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Intro_05,The hammer.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Intro_03,The spear.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Intro_04,The sword.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_19,This has continued for long enough.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_01,"This was to be expected, and yet…",
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_18,"Though I fight alongside them, I am an imposter.",
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_31,Very well.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_09,Was this a test?,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_05,"We are born into a world of strife, yet I seem to be the only one who does not revel in it.",
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_12,"When our battle began, something stirred within me.",
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Intro_02,Which weapon should I wield?,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_03,Why make me choose your weapon? Can you not choose for yourself?,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_10,Yes. A test.,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_07,Yet I feel no particular attraction to any of them. I feel only…,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_02,You wish to fight so badly?,
ST_D_FloatingCemetery/ST_D_FloatingCemetery_Chalier_Objective_30,You've made your choice. Now leave me be.,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_17,And the despair when they lost it all…,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_16,"Before the Fracture, I ran this establishment. The joy of seeing people revel in their fortunes…",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_04,Could you peasants please cease that infernal shouting?,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_EntranceGuy_06,Do you want help getting back down?,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_27,From simpler times.,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_25,"Here, try these on. They're from ancient times.",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_10,"I am a lone intellectual, cast aside by my people whose constant obsession with conflict drove me away.",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_EntranceGuy_05,"I ended up here after the Fracture and couldn't get back down. So, it's my whole world.",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_20,I feel you. Times were simpler back then.,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_07,I have no interest in conversing with uncultured humans. Leave.,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_15,I maintain this place even after its fall so its history is never forgotten.,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_18,I miss those times.,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_21,"I wish I could, but the illusion of past happiness is more appealing to me.",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_14,Indeed it is.,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_13,Isn't this the old Gestral casino?,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_23,"My friend, your clothing is a disaster.",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_EntranceGuy_07,"Nah, I'm good. Who'd watch over things if I left? Nah.",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_02,No response. Try again?,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_26,Now you'll look like a true gentleman.,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_End_02,"Oh hello, my friend.",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_05,"Oh, hello.",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_EntranceGuy_09,"Play some games, drink some drinks, gamble a bit, all the fun stuff. Now, it's like… well, you know… Anyway, just don't talk to that dimwit over there.",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_EntranceGuy_08,"See, this place is a living piece of history, used to be THE place to be, you know?",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_12,So it appears.,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_03,Still no answer. Try again?,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_EntranceGuy_11,"Such a downer, stuck in the past. Talk to him and he'll drown you in nostalgia.",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_29,"Thank you, my friend.",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_28,"Thank you, you most cultured swine.",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_End_01,The Gestral does not respond.,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_22,They sure were.,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_EntranceGuy_03,"This? Why, this is the whole world!",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_08,To what do I owe the pleasure of your company?,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_11,We are fellows then.,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_09,What are you doing hiding in here?,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_EntranceGuy_04,"What do you mean by ""the whole world""?",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_EntranceGuy_02,What is this place?,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_EntranceGuy_01,"What, what, humans? Up here? Whaaaat?",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_EntranceGuy_10,Who's that?,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_06,Why were you not answering?,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_19,"You must move on, my friend. Leave the past behind and look towards the future.",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_01,You see nobody inside. Do you call out?,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_24,You should wear something befitting your stature.,
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_31,"You're welcome, my new friend.",
ST_D_FlyingCasino/ST_D_FlyingCasino_InsideGuy_30,"You're welcome, you equally cultured swine.",
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_07,But instead I must occupy my time with… this.,
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_14,Go and play with your friends.,
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_03,Have you sufficiently recovered?,
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_12,I really don't have time for this.,
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_15,I'll handle this.,
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_04,"If so, then you can help. There's much left to do.",
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_13,It's probably for the best that you don't get involved. After what happened before…,
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_16,The woman has gone silent.,
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_11,Vengeance. I will settle this conflict once and for all.,
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_09,"What ""important matters""?",
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_08,What do you mean? What occupies your time?,
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_05,Who are you? Help with what?,
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_01,You may leave. I've no interest in speaking with you.,
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_02,You're awake? Hmm. Surprising.,
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_10,[dry laugh] An exercise in futility.,
ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield/ST_D_ForgottenBattlefield_FacelessClea_06,[sigh] I guess not. Pity. I'd hoped to return to more important matters.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Intro_09,"A ""fight?"" No, no, no, clearly you do not see. I am inviting you to the most intimate and elegant of dances.",
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Wanderer_01,"A mountain of ice, invaded by fire.",
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_End_12,A shame.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Intro_06,And battle…,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Wanderer_04,And what are those creatures at the top of the mountain?,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_End_10,As you wish.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_End_04,But our kind have travelled as far as we can go.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_End_09,Care for a final dance?,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Standby_08,Come.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Standby_02,Dance with me. Parry to the rhythm of my strikes.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Intro_07,Do you just want a fight? Is that it?,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_End_07,Everyone…,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Objective_04,Heights of which we can only dream.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Intro_01,Hmm. Humans…,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Intro_10,"How can you not care about the dance between life and death? It is thrilling, elegant, and the most intimate encounter you could ever have.",
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Intro_11,How is dancing during battle going to help us survive?,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_End_08,I do not believe you.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_End_11,I do not want to kill you.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Objective_03,"If you use this, perhaps you will attain new heights.",
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Objective_05,Is that all you have?,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Objective_02,It seems there is nothing more I can teach you.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Standby_07,It seems you are not worthy of true bliss.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Standby_06,Let us dance in a sea of fire and ice.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Intro_03,May you die without knowing true bliss.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Wanderer_02,Nevrons often resemble their environment.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Standby_05,No. I don’t think I will.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Standby_04,Okay… I'm ready.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Intro_08,Some of us don’t want to care about battle.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Wanderer_03,So… where did their fire come from?,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Intro_04,"Speak with honesty, humans.",
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Standby_03,Then might you witness true bliss.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_End_01,"These few follow me, but to little profit.",
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_End_03,They hope to learn from me.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Intro_05,We are rejoiced to know that humans care for our way of expression…,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_End_05,"Whereas humans? Gestrals? You may climb the tallest mountains, if you so wish.",
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_End_02,Why do you say that?,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_End_06,"With enough effort, everyone can achieve the same.",
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Intro_02,Would you care for a dance?,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Standby_01,You have much to learn. Allow me to demonstrate.,
ST_D_FrozenHearts/ST_D_FrozenHearts_Danseuse_Objective_01,Your dance was enthralling.,

ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Wipeout_Intro_03,A beach.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Ascension_FinishLine_05,"Actually, we can't really do that.",
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Wipeout_Intro_07,And I desperately need a new swimsuit.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_RaftVolley_Explanation_09,And I'll reward you with amazing stuff if you win.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Wipeout_FinishLine_02,And it's a human… Interesting.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_RaftVolley_Explanation_07,"Anyway, my creations will shoot baby gestrals at you, and you should throw them back.",
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_RaftVolley_Explanation_04,Baby gestrals?,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Race_Intro_06,Beat the race in under a certain time to receive rewards!,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Race_Results_03,Bronze,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Wipeout_Intro_10,"But if you ever manage, he will probably reward you greatly.",
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Wipeout_FinishLine_24,"But no, I don't.",
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Climb_05,"But they refused my reward, they said they would never wear any clothes.",
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Climb_06,"But you seem to enjoy clothes, perhaps you'll enjoy this.",
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Race_Explanation_03,"But you, you look different.",
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Ascension_FinishLine_03,"But your presence here is proof that you climbed the tower, like all of us here.",
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Climb_02,"Colour me impressed, you are the second expeditioner who managed to climb this wall.",
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_RaftVolley_Results_06,Come play again anytime.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Ascension_Celebration_04,Dance with us now!,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Wipeout_FinishLine_21,Do you have more?,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Wipeout_FinishLine_22,Do you think I'm some sort of professional swimsuit maker?,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Wipeout_Intro_12,Enjoy failing.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Wipeout_FinishLine_20,For the ladies.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Race_Results_05,Gold,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Ascension_Intro_04,"Golgra used to suck at climbing, so she built this to hone her skills!",

ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Race_Intro_05,Here we goooo!,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Wipeout_FinishLine_19,"Here, take this.",
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Wipeout_FinishLine_23,I am.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_RaftVolley_Explanation_05,I asked for their consent.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_RaftVolley_Explanation_03,I captured a few baby gestrals we can use as balls.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Ascension_FinishLine_02,I certainly wasn't expecting that.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Climb_07,"I found it in an old farmhouse along a cliff. It's so soft and pretty, looking at it made me happy.",
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Wipeout_FinishLine_03,I guess that deserves a reward.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Climb_08,I hope wearing it makes you happy too.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Race_Explanation_01,I made a little race here but no one ever wants to participate.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_Wipeout_FinishLine_08,I see what you mean.,
ST_D_GestralBeach/ST_D_GestralBeach_RaftVolley_Intro_09,"I see, you're not exactly brave.",

ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory3_03,Heheheheh!!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ShadyStreet4_01,Hello.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_JournalCollector_19,"Here, a gift for your travels.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_OnoPuncho_10,"Here, from my personal collection.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_PrivateClub2_01,Hey Expeditioner.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory4_01,Hey Expeditioners! Wanna help build the next model of Sakapatates?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ShadyStreet1_01,Hey humans.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar2_07,"Hey you old patate, could we go in the creepy alleyway over there? I want to show you something.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Intro_01,Hey you!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Hunter_20,"Hey, I hope I encounter one of you in the arena someday!",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar9_08,Hi!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_PrivateClub2_11,Higher chance.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Objective_07,Hm?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Intro_17,"Hmm, sounds like you need better gunpowder.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Intro_10,"Hmm. Good point. Alright, how can I help?",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House5_03,Hmmm- HMM??,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_PrivateClub2_13,Hmm… that's what a fool who doesn't like gambling would say.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House5_07,Hmph!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_OnoPuncho_06,How about it? Wanna try?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_14,How can I repay you?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ShadyStreet2_03,How long are we going to keep this stalemate?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Intro_09,How will I know if it's the BEST SAKAPATATE unless I test it against you?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_HangingGestral_Father_05,Huh?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House2_04,Huh?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_OnoPuncho_02,Huh?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Noco_Revived_01,Huh? Who are you?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House2_05,"I am a philosopher, I hope you buy my books someday.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_04,I am designing a new defensive attachment for the next Sakapatate… but I feel like I'm not that great at it.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Objective_18,I am one with the machine! HAHAHA!!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Infirmary1_05,I ate a lot of Nevrons.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_PrivateClub1_01,"I built all of this alone. I am classy, I am elegant, and yet they treat me like a monster.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_NearArena3_01,I came to see Matthieu the Colossus!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar8_03,I can hear you.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar8_04,I can still hear you.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Entrance2_07,I can't fight BALD! Although… Mandsol was bald and he's the greatest champion of all time. Hmm… that gives me an idea…,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Intro_19,I could see that during our fight too. You definitely need something stronger.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House7_01,"I didn't want him to be mad, I was only joking.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_03,"I do not know, I am just hitting my head on these sacks. [sigh]",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_31,I don't care.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_PrivateClub2_12,I don't care.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Infirmary1_01,I don't feel like healing people today.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Entrance1_03,I don't have a boat.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory4_07,I don't know what that is but it sounds cool.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Theater2_01,"I don't know which Gestral invented theatre, but they were a visionary!",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_06,I fear you are right.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_JournalCollector_03,"I got Moshi’s notes somewhere, if you’re interested.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_NearArena3_02,"I hope he's coming! Though rumour is, he's a mere bristle of his former self.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_NearFactory1_02,I hope they choose me as a test weapon!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_PrivateClub1_04,I hope we'll be alive to see it happen.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_10,"I just need to figure out an attack plan, then we'll chow down on Nevrons for breakfast!",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar4_02,I just traded all of my junk to get this.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_PrivateClub2_06,I knew it. I saw it in your eyes.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ShadyStreet3_02,"I know where you're hiding! Come here so I can put you down, you brush-headed twig!",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Entrance1_01,I like looking at the ground all day.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ShadyStreet1_11,"I like to watch, because I'm obsessed inside.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory2_05,"I love my job, it makes us stronger-",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Hunter_12,I managed to kill a Chromatic Nevron.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Infirmary3_02,"I mean, who wants to heal their cuts?? Keep your scars like a real Gestral, to remind you of the beauty of battle!",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory3_01,"I need to do it faster, heheheheh.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_09,I see you've met Verso. Hmmm.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Infirmary1_12,"I studied very hard, harder than anyone else to become a doctor.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ShadyStreet1_02,I suggest you turn back.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Standby_01,I swear there was this cavern with a large body of water! There were tons of blue mushrooms everywhere!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Joust2_02,I think I'll stick with the old method for now.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House4_02,I thought Gestrals were not affected by her power?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Street2_02,"I want to be a REAL Gestral hero, not a pretend one like those brushheads running around their stage.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_JournalCollector_08,"I want to reassemble the book for Ol’ Moshi. You lot have been travelling around, yeah? You seen any of these writings?",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar3_01,I want to trade your stuff for my stuff.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Infirmary1_08,I was born with this terrible sickness that makes my bones grow every day.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House5_04,I was having a nice little nap on my stairs. You better not have woken me up just so you could steal in my house.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory4_04,I was obviously joking. This task is way too complicated for pea-brained humans.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Infirmary2_02,"I'd rather die than come back to the village injured. Looks beyoooond boring, sleeping all day up there.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_23,I'll make the next shield even more powerful. As a thank you.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar4_07,"I'll own the Bazar thanks to ""Professor Champ de Cuivre's chromatic legumes""… you'll see.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Objective_05,I'll show you how to prepare it.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_NearArena4_05,"I'm a ""Julien-Tiny-Head"" fan.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_23,"I'm disappointed, that was barely a challenge.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_22,I'm going to enjoy destroying you. Again.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_NearArena2_07,"I'm just a little twig on your pathway, don't mind me.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_HangingGestral_Daughter_01,I'm not coming down!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar9_05,I'm paying.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Entrance3_01,I'm so tall now. Guess I'll die soon!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Entrance2_04,I'm too young to lose my bristles!!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_13,I've gotten more support from you in the past few minutes than the boss has ever given me in his lifetime!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Hunter_08,"I, {NpcName}, shall reward you handsomely for each Chromatic Nevron that you kill.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_14,If I see this idiot…,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Entrance3_05,If I'm lucky I'll become a weapon for a Sakapatate!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_JournalCollector_13,"If you find more journals, save me a copy, will ya?",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Hunter_07,"If you too yearn for glorious battles, then seek out these Chromatic Nevrons! Hunt them all!",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_PrivateClub2_07,"If you're really the gambling-type, you should be able to answer this correctly.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_NearFactory3_02,Imma beat you up!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Street1_01,In the palm of your hand I can read…,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ShadyStreet4_04,Indubitably.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_29,Is Monoco with you?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_VillageGates3_02,Is this your first time here?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Theater2_02,Isn't it just a smaller arena?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_11,It has been reported to me that Monoco has joined you.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Objective_09,It is indeed.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory4_08,It is. Heh heh heh.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Intro_23,"It was in a grotto somewhere. With lots of water. Argh, where was it again??",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Intro_12,It will be the ULTIMATE of Ultimate Sakapatates. The Ultra-Ultimate!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar1_03,"It's a barter system, bud, no currency.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory1_08,It's a wonder Gestrals have survived this long…,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_21,It's gonna be way more annoying. And by annoying I mean fuuun!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ManorDoor_07,"It's never opened before! At least, not for us Gestrals. Wowww.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ShadyStreet1_08,"It's the designated ""no-rule"" zone, so… you've been warned.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Street4_02,It's the newest trend in town.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Joust1_04,Jousting is still a form of fighting though.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar6_07,"Just for you, we'll trade the things we have!! You can even pay with Chroma! Spare us, please!",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Infirmary1_07,Just kidding.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_NearFactory2_04,KNEEEEE OF JUSTICE!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Theater5_01,Let's dance.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Entrance4_01,Let's enjoy this party!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_PrivateClub2_08,"Let's say that every time I hit, I have a 50% chance of dealing 100% more damage. What are my chances of dealing more damage in the long run?",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_PrivateClub2_10,Lower chance.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Intro_20,"Luckily, I know just the thing. It's not only more powerful, it's also easy to carry.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_JournalCollector_01,Lumièrans!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_NearArena2_01,Make way for the next Gestral hero.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_VillageGates1_02,"Make yourselves at home. If you're nice, you might get to enjoy an invigorating fight or two. Or fifty.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_PrivateClub2_18,May your battles bring you lots of excitement.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar8_02,Maybe he's just a jerk.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Street3_07,"Maybe later, though.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_VillageGates2_01,Me? I'm a nice brush.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar7_03,Means I'm callin' the guards on ya.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Noco_Revived_04,Memories he will never recover.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Entrance1_06,Mmmh.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_15,Monoco.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Objective_06,Monsieur Brushface?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_JournalCollector_17,Moshi will be so happy.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Entrance2_02,My birthday was yesterday…,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Joust2_01,"My hope is that one of these days, everybody's troubles will be resolved through jousting. I mean, fighting is so dépassé.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Joust1_07,"My kiddo prefers jousting to fighting… so if he ever knows that it's just fighting with more rules, he's gonna have a meltdown.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar2_01,My old patate says I'm too small a patate to fight Nevrons.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar5_01,"My shop is in the back alley. Want me to show you the good stuff, adventurers?",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Entrance1_04,Nevermind.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ArenaRegistrar_17,"Next time won't be so easy, I'm sure.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Objective_17,"No need, {NpcName}. It was a pleasure.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_18,No prize necessary. I enjoy holding grudges. Keeps me nice and cranky.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House3_06,No thanks.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ArenaRegistrar_08,"No worries though, I'll sign you up as a team. Just decide before each fight who gets the honour of getting beat up.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory1_05,No! It should attack Gestrals too so we can fight it!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_HangingGestral_Father_01,No!! My patate!!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar3_05,"No, I'll just stay here and look at your stuff.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House4_08,"No, they got beat up and left pretty fast.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ShadyStreet2_02,"No, you approach, stinkard!",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_21,No.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_PrivateClub2_04,No.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_27,No. But… you may visit the village if you wish.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Noco_Revived_03,Noco has lost a significant portion of his memories.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Street5_06,Noo! I didn't do anythinggg!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_NearFactory2_06,Noo- that'll just tickle him…,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House2_08,Nope.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Joust1_06,"Not everyone knows that, don't ruin the fun for them!",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_11,"Not that we eat Nevrons, of course. It is merely an expression.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_VillageGates1_04,Noted.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Street4_03,Nothing beats a good old fight to the death in the arena though.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Intro_05,Now are you gonna help me or what?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_24,Now go away and hide in shame.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Hunter_09,Now go! Make your people proud for the day you return to Lumière!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ArenaRegistrar_21,"Now that the tournament's over, I must say, you guys are a lot more entertaining than I thought.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_NearArena2_06,O-Okay.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar6_05,"OWW, THAT HURTS!!",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House4_03,Oh I know. I'm trying to speak your language.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar6_03,Oh we know. Our marks are the people with fat pockets.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_NearFactory1_04,"Oh yes, pain is life.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_JournalCollector_11,"Oh, but I’m not sure we’ll be back anytime soon.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory1_06,"Oh, good idea! Let's tell them that!",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ManorDoor_06,"Oh, so you've never been teleported to the ominous, perfectly maintained manor?",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar9_09,"Oh, uh, sorry, I'm out of stock. Try me next week.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Intro_18,Oh?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar1_05,Oh? But what use do you have for Chroma?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Objective_03,Ohhhhhh! You've got the mushroom!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ArenaRegistrar_07,"Oho, I appreciate the enthusiasm! Unfortunately, in the arena, it's one-on-one fights only.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Noco_Revived_02,Oh… hello.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_VillageGates3_10,"Ok, time to go train. Like Golgra says, time spent yapping is time you could have spent TRAINING. Wish me luck!",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_HangingGestral_Daughter_02,Ok.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Objective_04,Ok. Now what?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory3_05,"Okay, I guess.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_20,"Okay, change of plans! Time to really crank things up.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar3_06,"Okay, cool.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar6_06,"Okay, we're sorry!!",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Theater1_03,Okay.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Infirmary1_19,Ok… Sorry…,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_22,"Ooh, good, good.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Intro_13,Oooh. I respect your ambition.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_28,Or invite me next time you go adventuring.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ArenaRegistrar_18,Ouch. That's gotta hurt.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar5_03,Our shop is this way.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Street3_01,Over there is the… [gag],
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House5_05,"Owowow, okay, okay.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ShadyStreet3_01,PHILIPPE!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory4_05,Pea-brained? What do they teach you in school?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ManorDoor_03,"Pfft, of course you have. These doors are all over the continent.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_17,Piece of cake.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_NearFactory4_01,"Prepare for my ONE-INCH PUNCH. I'm gonna hit you so hard you're gonna crash headfirst into the Ancient Sanctuary, already planted for rebirth.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory4_02,Really?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_Fight_03,Really? A duel? Do you have a death wish?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House3_02,Really? Show me some philosophy then.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ArenaRegistrar_01,Registration for the tournament hasn't started yet. Come back later!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory5_09,Right!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ShadyStreet1_12,Rotten to the core.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_OnoPuncho_03,Rules are simple.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_PrivateClub2_09,Same chance.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Joust1_05,Shush!!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ShadyStreet3_03,Shut up!,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory2_03,Shut up~,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Factory4_06,Skool?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Entrance3_04,So I guess those were really dead Gestrals back there.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House7_03,"So I'll stand my ground, and pretend to be mad.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House4_09,"So about this previous expedition, you still don't remember their number?",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Infirmary1_16,So don't tell me what I am.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_House6_02,"So everybody wants me to go, is that it?!",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ArenaRegistrar_03,"So far, we've got sign-ups from three of our legendary champions! And… a mysterious new warrior.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Hunter_06,"So naturally, we wanted to fight them too. But many Gestrals have gotten squashed.",
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Infirmary1_11,"So one day I decided, I don't want anyone to suffer the way I do.",

ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_GustaveInvention_Intro_06,That depends. Are your Sakapatates going to keep attacking us?,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Bazar8_01,That old brush over there won't trade with anyone. I wonder what that's all about.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_Golgra_Fight_06,That wasn't half bad.,
ST_D_GestralVillage/ST_Dialog_GestralVillage_ShadyStreet1_06,That's an understatement.,

ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_Lumiere_04,"Thanks for the distraction… Now, let me sell you the real goods.",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_Visages_04,Thanks for the duel! It has been aaaages since I've had this much fun!,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_OldLumiere_03,That fight was BRILLIANT. I like you.,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_SacredRiver_03,"That was fun! No better place for a duel than the Sacred River! You've earned the right to trade for some real treasures. Here, take a look!",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_GestralVillage1_17,The Expedition Shop is back in business!,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_Visages_06,"Then the tremors came, the landscape changed, and… the humans were nowhere to be found.",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_WeaponsmithCruler_11,"They’re so powerful, they’re easy to swing, oooh, and they’re beautiful to boot! And since I’m in a happy mood, there’s a discount on everything!",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_OldLumiere_01,This place is an absolute wreck… but it's also pretty wicked.,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_SeaCliff_01,This place is just as beautiful as it is unsettling.,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_OrangeForest_01,This place is smashing. Definitely worth the trek here.,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_Sirene_01,Trade.,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_Goblu_01,Want to trade for my fabulous WARES?,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_MonocoStation_06,We are well-versed in methods of misdirection through the skillful application of sound.,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_WeaponsmithCruler_13,We can't exactly use your three-meter-long weapons.,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_WeaponsmithCruler_04,"We should have many more clients. We are, after all, the most talented people in our field.",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_WeaponsmithCruler_05,We take great pride in our craft. I believe a demonstration is in order. What do you say?,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_WeaponsmithCruler_08,Weapons.,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_GestralVillage3_03,"What I meant to say is, ""What a fashionable ensemble!""",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_GestralVillage3_06,What a duel! I'm so pumped!,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_GestralVillage1_21,"What a weird looking Pictos you have here, could you show it to me for a second?",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_YellowForest_01,"What is this place? I was travelling with my bruv, and he just left me here!",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_Monolith_01,"Whoah, whoah, whoah. Well, hello there. You're new. Haven't seen you lot before. How'd you get here? Me, I've been stuck here for ages.",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_Monolith_06,"Whoohoo! More duels, please, yes indeed!",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_WeaponsmithCruler_06,Why not. What exactly is your field?,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_GestralVillage1_10,Why? Are you desperate for clients?,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_CleasIsland_03,Woohoooooo!! I feel ALIVE!!,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_Monolith_03,"Would've been lonely too, nobody to talk to, 'cept I'm quite an adept conversationalist. Yeah, I can talk enough for two. That, and scavenging odds and ends has kept me quite busy. I am a merchant after all, and what's a merchant with no wares?",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_Optional2_01,"Yahoo! I can sell stuff! You gots Chroma, yeh?",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_GestralVillage1_15,"Yes! Whether it's weapons or pictos, I cater to your every need!",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_Monolith_07,"Yes, yes, you've definitely earned the right to shop my choicest goods!",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_GestralVillage1_25,You hand the {QuestItem} to {merchantName}.,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_SeaCliff_04,You have defeated me in a duel. Rest assured that NOTHING in this universe will stop you now.,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_GestralVillage1_22,"You see, I found a similar Pictos not too long ago. Let me see if–",
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_MonocoStation_04,You use weapons?,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_Optional3_02,You wanna be a merchant? You gotta get JACKED.,
ST_D_Merchants/ST_D_Merchants_Goblu_04,You've proven yourself WORTHY WARRIORS! I've got something special you might be interested in…,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Worried_07,"A lovely sentiment, but of little comfort to the many who have perished. I dare say their will was as strong as yours.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_01,Ahh…,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Training_02,"Almost, yeah, swing it more like this!",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Sciel_04,"And death the final chapter, where we shed our tears.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Lune_02,And often we fail to set sail.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Maelle_05,And often we find it's not much fun.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Sciel_02,And sometimes it's too much to bear.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Disapproving_09,"And that spirit we continue to honour. These days, our debates are more humble in nature, but that allows for a more intimate competitive environment.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Sciel_08,And we wonder why it’s so high.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Arguing_09,And yet you do not yield to reason.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Worried_04,"Anything is possible, if you have the will to see it through.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_WorldMapGuide_02,"Are you in search of your former home, Old Lumière?",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Intro_01,Are you ready?,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_07,"As a fashion designer, my talents languish from disuse.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Historian_01,"As some of us forget the history of our people, I thought it prudent to begin recording what I can.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_SittingOnTrain_01,As you likely observed upon your arrival.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Guard_04,"At least, I do now, now that the other guard is gone. They were quite loud and distracting!",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Weather_01,"Beautiful weather today, mm? Albeit a tad warm for my liking.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_06,"Because… there is no need for clothes. We run about, naked as the day we were born.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Weather_03,"Before the Fracture, our ancestral home lay high above the heavens, on mountains tipped with crystal clouds.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Weather_04,Blossoms of snowflakes graced our every breath.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Arguing_03,But I saw some of them.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_11,"But but but! Before I drape you with elegance, you must first best me in eloquence.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Training_08,But even the most persuasive of arguments cannot vanquish these creatures. And I am tired of hiding. I am tired of fleeing.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Sciel_09,But it leaves us asking why.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Sciel_06,But it’s lost in our cheers.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Lune_05,But often it feels like a butter knife.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Maelle_02,But sometimes it feels like a boring fight.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Maelle_08,But sometimes it's just a tease.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Disapproving_08,But the Games were not simply a competition between us. They were a celebration and a chance to come together.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Historian_05,But what if you forget?,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Worried_11,But… our enemy is ever at our door and they grow stronger and slyer with every passing day. Perhaps an evolution in strategy is required. Perhaps this is a necessary risk.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_SittingOnTrain_04,"Come on, it's not like that.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Guard_01,"Contrary to what some believe, guard duty is quite rewarding.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Lune_04,"Death the artist’s final stroke, completing every life.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Maelle_04,"Death untangles threads, revealing what’s begun.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_SittingOnTrain_06,Do not be concerned for us.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Disapproving_06,Do you still hold these Games?,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Maelle_07,"Eternity then cradles us, a promise to appease.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Reminiscing_02,Feels like only yesterday to me.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_SittingOnTrain_07,For we have faced every hardship imaginable.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Training_04,Forgive these old bones. Let me try once more.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Lune_06,Full of unnecessary rife.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Objective_02,Getting this was not easy.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_WorldMapGuide_07,"Good luck, Expeditioners.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_WorldMapGuide_01,"Greetings, Expeditioners.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_SittingOnTrain_05,Hah. We jest.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_WorldMapGuide_06,"Here, take this; it might aid in your survival. Good luck, Expeditioners.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Objective_06,Here. Have a look.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_MaleCharacter_01,Hmm.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_02,Hmm?,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Objective_02,Hold on for a moment. It is going to take some time to create my piece.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_SittingOnTrain_03,"However, with our esteemed Gestral having abandoned ship, we are compelled to undertake the task ourselves.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Standby_05,I already designed you a lovely outfit. I am interested in seeing what your friends are capable of.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Intro_02,I am developing something that will greatly increase our chances of survival and will undoubtedly aid you in battle as well.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_End_03,I am happy you enjoyed it. I personally enjoyed creating those outfits so I hope you wear them all the time.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Cleaners_01,"I can clear the snow and I can clear the rubble, but this is too much.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Reminiscing_01,I can't remember a time when we weren't hiding from the Nevrons.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Worried_05,"I don't know, but the only chance you have is if you stand together.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Guard_02,I find it meditative and instructional.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Arguing_02,"I have told you, we cannot see anything from up there.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Objective_03,I imagine not! The Nevrons there are quite lethal.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Intro_07,I just happen to have some. [Give {questItem}],
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Sculptor_02,I must say… looking back now…,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Intro_08,"I must warn you, the path to {levelName} will not be easy. Many threats await you there.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Guard_03,I observe and I learn. And I learn and I reflect.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Sculptor_01,I remember sculpting this statue.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Intro_03,"I require one final ingredient, the {questItem}, a type of ice that never melts.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Standby_01,I shall design new attire for the one able to best me in an eloquence battle.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Intro_02,I shall start. Finish my sentence in a wonderfully poetic way.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Builder_01,I should…,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Disapproving_04,"I still remember the excitement of the Oratory Games. Every four years, the greatest minds came together to demonstrate their mastery over the spoken word.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Historian_07,"I suppose then, the history of our people will slowly be forgotten.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Amazed_06,I think you would enjoy a visit to Lumière.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Standby_01,I will be able to augment your defenses if you bring me some {questItem}.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Shy_03,I wish to be alone.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Amazed_08,I would very much love to go to Lumière one day.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_WorldMapGuide_03,"If so, I fear you are on the wrong path.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Historian_04,"If someone forgets our history, I will simply tell them!",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Arguing_04,"If you are to scout for Nevrons, could you please do so at the Station entrance?",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Sculptor_07,"If you pay attention, there are numerous such statues in the Frozen Hearts.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_ExitGuide_02,"If your destination is Old Lumière, you should leave via the other exit.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Lune_09,In a language we cannot decipher.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Worried_08,"In that, we agree. But do we stand and fight together? Or do we retreat and flee together?",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Training_06,"In the old days, reason and logic led the way. We debated with vigour and sincerity and we rewarded truth, clarity, and sound judgement.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Shy_02,Is the Nevron gone?,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Cleaners_03,It does not obstruct the way. It is simply… there.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_14,It is a battle that consists of three rounds.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Amazed_04,"It is astonishing, is it not?",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Amazed_01,"It is true, the Fracture brought its share of ills, but there is beauty in its aftermath.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Sciel_01,"It meets the sea’s embrace, where sorrow turns to air.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Scouts_01,"It was pleasant meeting the merchant, but things could have become perilous. We did well to return.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Lune_07,"Its echoes fade to stillness, our secrets follow after.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Sciel_07,"Its light will softly fade, where weary skies lie.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_10,Let me dress you. You and your two marvellous friends.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Historian_06,Let me think on that.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Result_07,Let us continue.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Fashionist_04,"Life blooms like a rose, with petals soft and frail…",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Fashionist_03,"Life dances on the edge of time, a flicker in the breeze…",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Fashionist_01,"Life is but a fleeting dream, a whisper in the night…",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Fashionist_06,"Life sings a song of joy and pain, its notes both sweet and bitter…",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Fashionist_09,"Life's a blazing comet, racing through the sky…",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Fashionist_05,Life’s a canvas painted with the colours of our strife…,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Fashionist_07,Life’s a river winding through the valleys of despair…,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Fashionist_08,Life’s a story written with the ink of dreams and fears…,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Grateful_01,"Many challenges lie ahead, for both your kind and ours.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Cleaners_02,Must we truly dispose of this thing?,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_08,My life needs colours and textures!,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Objective_05,My work is complete.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Historian_03,"No, no. I record everything in my mind.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Disapproving_07,"Not as they once were, for the three great Grandis tribes no longer exist. We are all that remain.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Training_07,Not fists and force.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Amazed_07,Oh yes.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_09,Oh! I have a brilliant idea.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Training_03,"Oh, my achy bones. Yes, yes, you young folk have swayed my views. We must adopt the Gestral way. Alas, though my mind is in agreement, my body is recalcitrant.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Arguing_11,"Oh, so you wish to trade barbs? Very well. Let us have a proper debate.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Training_01,"One more time, just like Monoco showed us.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Grateful_03,Our resources are modest but we hope this gift may be of use to you.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Training_09,Our words fall upon deaf ears. They care not for reason. They will do what they wish with nary a care for our pleas.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Worried_09,Perhaps it is time to find a new home.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Intro_01,Perhaps we can help each other.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Grateful_02,Please. Take this.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Result_02,Poetic and magnificent.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Worried_10,Precisely. Our knowledge of the terrain and our skills at misdirection have allowed us to survive. To change course and provoke direct conflict is foolhardy.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Arguing_10,Reason has yet to grace you with her presence.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Arguing_05,Recall when Monoco and the others faced the ice behemoth. The one with the pointy bits.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_WorldMapGuide_04,Retrace your steps and take the alternate exit from the Station.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Intro_05,"Retrieve the {questItem} and, for a fair price, I will use it to augment your defenses. What say you?",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Standby_02,Shall we begin?,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Cleaners_04,"Shall we leave it here, then?",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Intro_09,So I wish you good luck.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Sculptor_06,So we did this.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Training_10,So. We are forced to meet them on their terms. Not with rhetoric. But with power.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Standby_02,Some can be found deep within the mountains of {levelName}.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_SittingOnTrain_02,Some notable activity transpires occasionally at the station.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Worried_01,"Some think to fight back, to strike directly against the Nevrons in open battle.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_03,Sorry?,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_13,Sounds great.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_WorldMapGuide_05,Surviving in these frozen lands will prove quite a challenge.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Amazed_02,"Take these stations, scattered across the mountains. Though not their original purpose, they have sheltered us well and become our cherished home.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_End_02,Thank you. It was nice to learn about your culture.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Result_06,That did not flow.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_MerchantQuest_Intro_06,That is an enticing offer.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Historian_02,"That is great to hear. Do you write, then?",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Standby_04,That is too bad. Maybe next time.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Arguing_07,"That up there is the perfect vantage point. Had I stood watch from there, we would have had ample warning.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Result_04,That was not very poetic.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Objective_04,That was… quite terrible. Come back again after you have trained.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Training_05,The Gestrals have defended their home. They were never forced to flee. We must try the same. Monoco has shown us how to defeat them!,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Disapproving_01,The Grandis lived peaceful lives long before the Paintress emerged.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Weather_05,The blizzards of yesteryear were a sight to behold… and quite invigorating to experience.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Disapproving_05,The debates were fierce and lengthy. I recall one bout that lasted 96 hours!,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Amazed_05,The many wonders your ancestors have wrought.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Scouts_03,The object at the centre of the crater vanished some time ago. I wonder what it was?,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Disapproving_02,The three great Grandis tribes were renowned for the artistry of their discourse.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Standby_03,Then let us commence.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Worried_12,"There is much to ponder and no easy answers. But that is life, I suppose. Thank you for listening to my worries.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Scouts_02,There is too much we do not know about the crater. The Nevrons there are fierce.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Sculptor_05,There was a time when the tribes sought to compete in a different manner than through eloquence battles.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Objective_03,There. I am proud of this one.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Sculptor_08,They are from a time before the Nevrons… when we had the leisure to do as we pleased.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Arguing_08,This is becoming tiresome.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Grateful_04,"This is very kind, thank you.",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_ExitGuide_01,This pathway leads to the treacherous region of the mountains.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Worried_02,Though we are strangers to the mindset of war and outmatched in strength and numbers.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_15,Three rounds where one must display an excellence in poetry.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Fashionist_02,"Through the veil of shadows, life's mysteries are spun…",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Maelle_06,Till everything comes undone.,

ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Worried_03,"We have the will, but have we the way?",
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Disapproving_03,"We too once had grand arenas, like the Gestrals. But within our arenas, eloquence landed the killing blows.",

ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_FashionistQuest_Intro_12,What?,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Lune_03,Where even the strong ones pale.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Maelle_03,Where everyone just wants to take flight.,
ST_D_MonocoStation/ST_D_MonocoStation_Eloquence_Sciel_05,Where the plot is full of jeers,

ST_D_MonolithClimb/ST_D_MonolithClimb_TrainBoy_09,Your maman bought you… an entire train?,
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_17,All of them?,
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_14,All the beauty in the world she’d never get to experience. That saddened her.,
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_08,Are you talking about the Paintress?,
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_03,Are you… a spirit? Trapped in the Gommage?,

ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_06,"But when I asked her about her sadness, her answer surprised me.",
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_15,I encouraged them to believe that their dreams are within their grasp. But she proved me a liar.,
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_01,"I have nothing but time, I suppose. To sit and think.",
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_20,"I paint them, so that I can remember them. Remember their faces…",
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_18,"It’s important to remember the ones we love. To keep them alive in our minds when they are far away. Far, far away.",
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_16,"She did love to challenge me. Of all of them, she and I are the most alike.",
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_10,She paints.,
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_12,She was sad because there are more works of art than she’d ever be able to see in her lifetime.,
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_11,She wasn’t scared of death itself.,
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_09,She who painted Nevrons…,
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_13,So many fables from around the world that she’d never be able to collect. To bring to life in her workshop.,

ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_04,"These days, I am just a man who sits and thinks.",

ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_05,"When she was young, she’d get sad thinking about mortality.",
ST_D_OldLumiere/ST_D_OldLumiere_SpiritRenoir_07,Who are you talking about?,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_LadyOfSap_01,(Is this the person the boy mentioned?),
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_LadyOfSap_09,(It has gone silent again… We should report back to the boy.),
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_LadyOfSap_NotStarted_01,(It's not talking.),
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_06,A few of your Expeditioner friends are here too.,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Intro_12,A part of her is around here.,

ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_02,Everyone wants to fight all the time. But I just want to enjoy these falling leaves.,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_16,Have fun and try not to die.,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_LadyOfSap_04,"He asked, why are your paintings taking us all?",
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_LadyOfSap_02,Hey…,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_LadyOfSap_05,I do it for him…,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_LadyOfSap_06,I do it for us…,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Intro_03,I thought her paintings took you all.,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Intro_04,I wish I could understand…,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_09,Just avoid going to the top of the cliff and you'll be fine.,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_01,"Oh, hello. I suppose you want to fight?",
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_08,"Oh, yeah, no, they're dead. Easy to spot, you'll see them along the way.",
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_03,"Oh, you're the first person I've met who doesn't.",
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_07,Other survivors?! Can you show us?,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Standby_01,Please find her… And ask her why she kills them all…,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Objective1_06,Please… Maybe you can do it… Stop her paintings from erasing any more…,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Objective1_02,Really? What did she say?,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Standby_04,She is around here… In this forest…,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Intro_07,She's always been there. From the moment I was born.,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_15,Suit yourself. I'll keep an eye out for Expedition 32.,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Objective2_03,"Take this. It is a song she used to play to me, when we were together…",
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Intro_11,Thank you…,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Objective2_02,Thank you… Thank you…,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_12,Thanks for the warning. We'll stay away.,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_17,Thanks.,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Objective1_03,"That she is doing this for you. To respect what you created, with her.",

ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_10,The big one over there is…,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_End_01,The boy has gone silent.,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_LadyOfSap_07,To respect… What he created… What we created…,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_05,"Uh, it's a forest. Can't you see?",
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Objective1_01,We found her.,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_LadyOfSap_03,"We met a boy, he asked us to talk to you.",
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Standby_02,We will.,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Intro_10,We'll try to find her.,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_13,We're going to go anyway.,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_LadyOfSap_08,What does that mean?,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_04,What is this place?,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Standby_03,Where can we find her?,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Intro_06,Who are you talking about?,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Intro_05,Why she does that…,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_14,"Wow, an Expeditioner who listens.",
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_GestralEntrance_11,"Yeah, maybe don't go there.",
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Objective2_01,You succeeded…,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Intro_01,You…,
ST_D_OrangeForest/ST_D_OrangeForest_FacelessBoy_Intro_02,You… breathe?,
ST_D_Reacher/ST_D_Reacher_SpiritRenoir_04,Death is over in an instant. But the one who survives carries that death for the rest of their lives.,
ST_D_Reacher/ST_D_Reacher_SpiritRenoir_06,I find myself grieving before they’ve even passed. Grieving what could have been. Grieving what is to come.,
ST_D_Reacher/ST_D_Reacher_WorkshopOrphelin_02,It does not sabotage. It builds.,
ST_D_Reacher/ST_D_Reacher_SpiritRenoir_07,She’ll never forgive herself… She’ll carry her scars with her always.,
ST_D_Reacher/ST_D_Reacher_SpiritRenoir_05,"Some might say that's lucky. Not simply because you survived, but because you had the opportunity to care deeply for another.",
ST_D_Reacher/ST_D_Reacher_SpiritRenoir_09,The man has gone silent.,
ST_D_Reacher/ST_D_Reacher_WorkshopOrphelin_01,This Orphelin is different from the rest.,
ST_D_Reacher/ST_D_Reacher_SpiritRenoir_03,To be the one who survives.,
ST_D_Reacher/ST_D_Reacher_SpiritRenoir_02,To die.,
ST_D_Reacher/ST_D_Reacher_SpiritRenoir_01,"Which is worse? To die, or to be the one who survives? To grieve? Or to be grieved?",
ST_D_Reacher/ST_D_Reacher_SpiritRenoir_08,Would that I could ease her burden.,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective4_01,All this chroma has been rather… energising.,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Intro_01,An odd looking fountain.,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective3_05,And they overcome.,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective1_04,"But alas, not all.",
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective1_06,"But the more they pondered, the more it consumed them whole.",
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective4_03,Did my tales interest you this much?,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective3_04,Families reunite.,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_End_04,I am… different. My presence on this continent was deemed an offence by those who have already claimed these territories.,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_End_02,I apologise… I do not have any more tales to tell.,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_End_05,I had to give up on my travels. I then found this resting place… You know the rest.,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_End_01,I take it you want more of my rambling?,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective4_04,I'm afraid I have no more to share… but you can have this.,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective3_03,In the face of countless trials…,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective1_05,Long had they thought the answer obvious.,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective1_02,Many have pondered this question.,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective1_03,Most have understood its complexity.,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_End_08,No matter. I accept this trial.,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_End_06,Reflection and meditation have brought me to an answer. I shall live on and have my own tale about my own trials and tribulations.,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective2_02,"Still, it has broken the minds of many…",
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective4_02,"Thanks to you, I awaken from my slumber.",

ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective1_01,…Must minds created by man be considered false?,
ST_D_RedWoods/ST_D_RedWoods_Benisseur_Objective3_01,…Such a beautiful painting. Tainted by suffering.,
ST_D_RenoirDrafts/ST_D_RenoirDrafts_SimonUnleashed_04,A family life.,
ST_D_RenoirDrafts/ST_D_RenoirDrafts_SimonUnleashed_03,A lonely life.,
ST_D_RenoirDrafts/ST_D_RenoirDrafts_SpiritRenoir_01,Aline and I. We used to understand each other. Both of us lived for the process of creation. More so than the product.,
ST_D_RenoirDrafts/ST_D_RenoirDrafts_SpiritRenoir_10,Aline…,
ST_D_RenoirDrafts/ST_D_RenoirDrafts_SpiritRenoir_03,"But she's changed. She no longer cares for the act of painting, only what her painting can achieve. And she will drive herself mad trying to paint what is unpaintable.",
ST_D_RenoirDrafts/ST_D_RenoirDrafts_SpiritRenoir_02,"Capturing the essence of an idea - half-formed, nebulous, teetering on the edge of existence. Shaping it into being.",
ST_D_RenoirDrafts/ST_D_RenoirDrafts_SpiritRenoir_07,Creation requires the will to act. So every painting I make is proof that I have not surrendered to despair.,

ST_D_RenoirDrafts/ST_D_RenoirDrafts_SpiritRenoir_06,"It is the process that moves me. Being able to shape and mould a composition helps me to understand and create order, to tame the chaos and create something unique to me.",
ST_D_RenoirDrafts/ST_D_RenoirDrafts_SpiritRenoir_04,"Judging by these paintings, some might say the same of you.",
ST_D_RenoirDrafts/ST_D_RenoirDrafts_SpiritRenoir_08,Not much daylight between the two. I live it every day. It's why I paint.,

ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_End_07,But right now… I can hear it-,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_Objective_04,But this silence… this screaming silence…,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_Intro_04,Can you believe it?,

ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_Intro_01,I didn't want to kill my friends.,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_End_15,I do not know more than this.,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_Intro_02,I just wanted to play with them.,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_End_16,I see…,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_Intro_08,I will never play again…,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_End_18,I'll make sure to kill you this time.,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_Intro_13,I'm afraid none of us are familiar with your instrument.,

ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_Objective_02,Right. Let's do it.,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_Intro_11,Teach me. Teach me how to not kill.,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_Intro_12,Teach me… how to play.,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_End_12,Those who seek Chroma.,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_Objective_11,To prove my gratitude.,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_End_14,To… deny them.,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_Intro_19,Truly?,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_Intro_18,"Um, well, perhaps we could help you practise?",
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_Objective_09,Wait!,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_End_17,We could never have been friends.,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_End_11,We… are expected to kill the Mistress' enemies.,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_End_02,Why were you so upset earlier?,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_End_13,Why?,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_Intro_20,Yes. Help me learn how to not kill!,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_End_03,You said earlier that you are expected to kill?,
ST_D_StoneQuarry/ST_D_StoneQuarry_TroubadourCantPlay_End_01,You're here again. Would you like to hear me play?,
ST_D_SunlessCliffs/ST_D_SunlessCliffs_ChromaDoor_08,All have performed through the veil.,
ST_D_SunlessCliffs/ST_D_SunlessCliffs_ChromaDoor_01,Chroma moves inside the frame.,

ST_D_SunlessCliffs/ST_D_SunlessCliffs_ChromaDoor_06,The mime has conveyed his true art unreserved.,
ST_D_SunlessCliffs/ST_D_SunlessCliffs_ChromaDoor_07,The mime's display left the crowd quite unnerved.,
ST_D_SunlessCliffs/ST_D_SunlessCliffs_ChromaDoor_05,The price is paid. And a reward is served.,
ST_D_SunlessCliffs/ST_D_SunlessCliffs_ChromaDoor_04,"This person has played, and received the reward they deserved.",
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_02,A Grandis? What are you doing here?,
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_21,"After all, this is what my friends would have wanted…",
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_03,"Ah, I've been lost in these sunless woods for as long as I can remember. Luckily, I fell in with a rather ""lively"" crowd of Gestrals.",
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_16,And just like that… I lost all my friends.,
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_08,"And though my Gestral friends could resurrect, the death toll grew so high that it overwhelmed the queue at their Sacred River.",
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_18,"Anyway… I have worked tirelessly on improving their Sakapatate, to properly honour their memory.",
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_01,"Greetings! Oh my, I've not met an Expeditioner in quite some time. Or anyone else, for that matter. Hello, hello, how wonderful to meet you!",
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_13,"I believe they're still there now, awaiting their turn at the River.",
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_19,"If you find them walking around, feel free to fight them!",
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_11,"It broke my heart, it did. I couldn't bear it anymore, so I wrote to Golgra for help.",
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_17,"It is a lonely, albeit more peaceful life these days.",
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_10,Losing their memory of me each time…,
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_20,Please do enjoy a good fight against my Sakapatates. They're roaming about these woods.,
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_06,"Sadly, it also resulted in quite the death toll. And not all of it at the hands of Nevrons.",
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_15,Such is the Gestral way.,
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_14,That must be… hard…,
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_12,That was perhaps not the best idea. Golgra's solution was rather… severe. Golgra decided to kill every Gestral here and plant their bodies in the Ancient Sanctuary.,
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_07,"Their zest for battle sometimes went too far, friendly fire and all that. Or maybe unfriendly fire.",
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_05,"They do so love to fight, which resulted in quite a bit of breakage.",
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_04,"They welcomed me as one of their own! It helped, I suppose, that I am an engineer by trade and could fix their weapons and Sakapatates.",
ST_D_TwilightSanctuary/ST_D_TwilightSanctuary_Engineer_09,They were all my friends… And they kept dying and resurrecting…,
ST_D_Visages/ST_D_Visages_Mask_Intro_01,A mask. It seems connected to the Axon.,

ST_DS_Camp/10_AftermathVersoMaelle_Verso,Aline wants her son back. Renoir wants you and Aline back. You want Gustave back. The cycle we needed to break wasn’t the Gommage. It’s your family’s cycle of grief.,

ST_DS_Camp/06_CampMsLune_Lune,Amazing. I wonder if we can achieve something similar…,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampMsSciel_Verso,An appropriate amount of trouble.,

ST_DS_Camp/10_CampEnSciel_Sciel,And I understand… better than anyone. You know that.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampAct3BSciel_Verso,And all the expeditioners I travelled with. It would be nice to tell them… we made it.,

ST_DS_Camp/04_CampGvMaelle_Maelle,And miss the chance to meet Esquie? No way!,

ST_DS_Camp/07_CampMsMonoco_Monoco,Bah. It’s been ten years! Golgra needs to get over it.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampA2Esquie_Esquie,Because we’re buddies! François is so fun.,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampFbLune_Lune,Because… he liked the idea of friendships that could last decades.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampMsSciel_Sciel,Bet you guys got up to lots of trouble together.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel,Better?,
ST_DS_Camp/06_AftermathVersoEsquie_Esquie,But I can never be mad at you.,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampMsNoco_Verso,But I didn’t see a present? What was it?,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampMiMaelle_Verso,But relieved.,
ST_DS_Camp/12_CampMaelleLune_Lune,But what I needed… was to use it. To use everything.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampMaelleSciel_Maelle,Can you teach me to fight better?,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampAct3AMonoco_Monoco,Can’t rely on good hair and charm anymore. So what’s the plan?,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampMiMaelle_Verso,Conflicted.,

ST_DS_Camp/05_CampAct3BLune_Verso,Do you mean…,
ST_DS_Camp/13_Sisters_Verso,Do you want the armband back?,
ST_DS_Camp/05_AftermathLadies_Lune,Don’t apologise. You were trapped too. You lived among us. You’re one of us. Even if you’re also one of them.,
ST_DS_Camp/32_CampMaelleLune_Lune,Don’t tell anyone else I said that.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampMsLune_Verso,"Don’t worry, he’s not interested in human feet.",
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampMsMonoco_Monoco,"Ehhhhh. Well, Golgra helped Noco start his merchant shop…",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampMsEsquie_Verso,Eh… I don’t think they’ll like that–,
ST_DS_Camp/10_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel,Emotion can mess with your perceptions. Make you miss important details on the field.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel,"Emotions are powerful. You have to make sure they work with you, not against you.",

ST_DS_Camp/09_AftermathVersoSciel_Sciel,Everything I knew about our world is wrong. And you know what?,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampScLune_Lune,Expedition Zero left sixty seven years ago. Which would make you–,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampA2Sciel_Sciel,"Extra long for you, I imagine.",
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampMsLune_Lune,Feet? Really?,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampAct3AMaelle_Verso,Fine. As you wish.,
ST_DS_Camp/14_CampScielEsquie_Esquie,First means number one. Second means number two.,
ST_DS_Camp/11_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel,Fixate on the wrong thing. Or see what you want to see.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampMiEsquie_Esquie,François and I were just trying to say hello! But she wouldn’t let us. Luckily you found us instead.,

ST_DS_Camp/02_CampMaelleLune_Lune,Hey…,
ST_DS_Camp/03_AftermathVersoMaelle_Maelle,He’s been weakened by his battle with Maman. That’s probably why he hasn’t come after us. But it won’t stop him for long.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampOlEsquie_Verso,"He’s not– [exhale] I know, buddy. I’m mad too.",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel,High praise.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampA2Sciel_Sciel,Hm.,

ST_DS_Camp/06_CampScielEsquie_Esquie,Hm? I didn’t say that.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampOlSciel_Verso,Hmm.,
ST_DS_Camp/12_CampA2Sciel_Verso,Hmm.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampA1Esquie_Verso,Hmm. I recognize that look. What’s got you so grumpy?,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampFbMaelle_Maelle,How come Monoco lives so far from the other gestrals?,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampGobLune_Lune,How did the Gestrals survive out here?,
ST_DS_Camp/28_CampMaelleLune_Maelle,How do you always know what to do…,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampMiMaelle_Verso,How do you feel? After…,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampFbSciel_Sciel,How far up the mountain is Monoco’s Station? Will we see snow?,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampScSciel_Verso,How open-minded of you.,
ST_DS_Camp/14_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel,"How they move, how they think, how they react, so you can anticipate and adjust.",
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampMsNoco_Noco,Hrmph! You’ll just have to wait and find out. But it’s SUPER cool.,
ST_DS_Camp/07_Sisters_Maelle,Huh.,
ST_DS_Camp/31_CampMaelleLune_Maelle,Huh. Really?,
ST_DS_Camp/20_CampMaelleLune_Lune,I can almost feel them beside me. Everyone we’ve lost… walking with me.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_AftermathLadies_Lune,I can’t believe there’s another world out there. A world I’ll never get to see.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampA2Lune_Lune,I can’t believe we’re this close.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampGobLune_Lune,I can’t wait to ask them. Gestrals!,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampScEsquie_Verso,"I could say the same for you, you giant marshmallow. Bet you lost your stones again?",
ST_DS_Camp/17_Sisters_Verso,I did. You’re not upset with me?,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampOlSciel_Verso,I didn’t think you cared about odds.,

ST_DS_Camp/15_Sisters_Verso,"I feel like a fraud, wearing it. Given, you know…",
ST_DS_Camp/29_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,I guess I do.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampAct3AEsquie_Verso,I guess he’s not that different from my father.,

ST_DS_Camp/07_CampMaelleSciel_Maelle,I know.,
ST_DS_Camp/14_CampEnSciel_Sciel,I like having you in my life.,
ST_DS_Camp/10_AftermathLadies_Maelle,"I love my family, but… they’re all gone. In one way or another. And you’re my family too. So are Gustave and Emma.",
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampA2Esquie_Esquie,I miss Soarrie.,
ST_DS_Camp/07_CampMaelleLune_Lune,I miss him too.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_VersoSelfLune_Verso,I promised Lune I’d help her find her parents.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_VersoSelfMaelle_Verso,I promised Maelle I’d help her find Alicia.,
ST_DS_Camp/07_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,I remember it quite clearly.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampGvSciel_Sciel,"I still can’t believe it. I lost hope after a while, but you all survived.",
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampEnMaelle_Maelle,I think you and Esquie are soul mates.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampEnSciel_Gustave,I think you have a new best friend.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_AftermathVersoSciel_Verso,I thought you’d be more upset.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_VersoSelfMonoco_Verso,I told Monoco I’d help him bring Noco back.,
ST_DS_Camp/18_CampMaelleLune_Lune,"I use the pain, I use the fear, the shame, the guilt, the anger, I use it all to keep going. To make sure. I. Continue.",
ST_DS_Camp/02_AftermathVersoLune_Lune,I was right not to trust you.,
ST_DS_Camp/07_AftermathVersoSciel_Sciel,I was. I got over it.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampA2Maelle_Maelle,I wish Gustave was here.,
ST_DS_Camp/04_AftermathVersoLune_Lune,"I wouldn’t have betrayed my expedition. I would have warned them that everyone they cared about was about to be erased. That THEY were about to be erased. I would have told them the truth. Because after everything we’ve been through, we deserved that.",
ST_DS_Camp/12_CampEnSciel_Sciel,I'm just glad Lune found you… before it was too late.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampEnSciel_Gustave,"I, uh– After the beach… when I was alone, um– I almost…",
ST_DS_Camp/08_CampMsLune_Lune,If we combine this with Pictos could we selectively use Nevron abilities in battle–,
ST_DS_Camp/04_AftermathVersoMaelle_Verso,"If you and your father keep fighting, you risk breaking the world again. Another Fracture, but this time, it might be you trapped inside the Monolith.",
ST_DS_Camp/10_CampScielEsquie_Esquie,In the caves? Yeah.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampAct3BMonoco_Monoco,Indeed. Life is more colourful with Noco by my side.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampMsMonoco_Monoco,Is Golgra still mad at me?,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampAct3BSciel_Sciel,Is there anyone special you’d want Maelle to bring back? You’ve been around for 100 years. Anyone you miss?,
ST_DS_Camp/18_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,It was you.,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampA2Sciel_Verso,It’s been a long road to get here.,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampMaelleLune_Lune,It’s fine.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampAct3ASciel_Sciel,"It’s not that I didn’t care before. I cared about the mission, but now…",
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampA2Sciel_Verso,"It’s nothing, just nerves.",
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampGvMaelle_Gustave,It’s safer in the village.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampAct3ALune_Lune,"It’s strange, watching her.",
ST_DS_Camp/08_CampMaelleLune_Maelle,It’s… it’s hard.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_AftermathLadies_Maelle,It’s… so weird. I have memories of two childhoods. Two homes. Two Lumières.,
ST_DS_Camp/14_CampMaelleLune_Lune,I– Mm.,
ST_DS_Camp/24_CampMaelleLune_Maelle,I’d like to feel him with me too…,
ST_DS_Camp/06_AftermathMonoco_Verso,I’ll do my best to earn their trust back.,
ST_DS_Camp/07_CampMsLune_Verso,I’ll stick to my swords. I’m not too keen on turning into a Nevron.,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampMiSciel_Verso,I’m curious what you think.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampAct3AMaelle_Maelle,"I’m getting quite tired of people telling me to go home. So please, no more.",
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampOlEsquie_Esquie,I’m mad.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampScLune_Verso,"I’m not going to get much sleep tonight, am I?",
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampAct3BMaelle_Verso,I’m not really inspired these days.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampGobLune_Gustave,I’m not sure.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampGvMaelle_Maelle,I’m ok. We stick together.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampOlMonoco_Verso,"I’m ready, just say the word.",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampMiMonoco_Verso,I’m seeing this through.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampOlMonoco_Verso,"I’m sorry, mon vieux. We’ll bring Noco back.",
ST_DS_Camp/04_AftermathLadies_Maelle,I’m sorry. I didn’t– My memories– I would’ve told you if I’d known–,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampOlEsquie_Esquie,I’m stinking mad.,
ST_DS_Camp/07_CampA1Esquie_Esquie,I’m supposed to fly too!,
ST_DS_Camp/02_AftermathVersoMaelle_Verso,I’m surprised he hasn’t already.,
ST_DS_Camp/11_CampMaelleLune_Lune,I’ve tried many ways of dealing with it. Running from it. Sitting with it. Compartmentalising it.,
ST_DS_Camp/26_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,I… uh…,
ST_DS_Camp/13_CampEnSciel_Sciel,Just like whoever found me.,
ST_DS_Camp/07_AftermathVersoLune_Verso,"Knowing what you know now, would you have helped me force my mother out of the Canvas?",
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampAct3BEsquie_Esquie,Let’s explore under the ocean!,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampAct3BMaelle_Maelle,"Let’s see if Esquie has more of that wine you like, maybe that’ll help.",
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampGvLune_Lune,Losing an arm is quite a lemon.,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampOlSciel_Sciel,Lune and I have less than a year. But Maelle’s different.,
ST_DS_Camp/08_CampEnSciel_Gustave,Lune told you.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_AftermathVersoLune_Verso,Lune…,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampOlLune_Verso,Lune…,
ST_DS_Camp/19_CampMaelleLune_Maelle,Lune…,
ST_DS_Camp/34_CampMaelleLune_Display,"Maelle and Lune spend more time together, in a moment that was special for both of them.",
ST_DS_Camp/19_CampMaelleSciel_Display,Maelle and Sciel spend more time together.,
ST_DS_Camp/13_AftermathVersoMaelle_Display,"Maelle and Verso’s relationship has changed, but their trust in each other has not been broken.",
ST_DS_Camp/A01_CampMaelleLune_Display,Maelle quietly approaches Lune…,
ST_DS_Camp/A01_CampMaelleSciel_Display,Maelle stares at the stars.,
ST_DS_Camp/12A_AftermathLadies_Sciel,Maelle.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampAct3ALune_Verso,Maelle?,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampAct3AMaelle_Verso,Maelle…,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampGvMaelle_Gustave,Maelle…,
ST_DS_Camp/08_CampA1Esquie_Verso,Maybe stop losing your rocks then. How do you lose them anyway? Don’t you swallow the rocks?,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampAct3BMonoco_Verso,Maybe we could stop by the Gestral Village for a little bit? We need more supplies anyway.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampGvMaelle_Gustave,Maybe you should stay…,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampA1Monoco_Monoco,Maybe.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_AftermathVersoMaelle_Verso,Maybe… Maybe you should go home.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampA2Esquie_Verso,Me too.,
ST_DS_Camp/07_CampScLune_Lune,Mhm.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampOlLune_Lune,Mm.,
ST_DS_Camp/12_Sisters_Maelle,Mm. Yeah.,
ST_DS_Camp/07_CampMsSciel_Sciel,Mmm. I’ve spent some time with Gestrals. I’m not sure we have the same definition of “appropriate.”,
ST_DS_Camp/35_CampScielEsquie_Esquie,"Mmm. Yeah. I get sad too, when I lose my stones. But I always find them again. You will find them again too.",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampA2Esquie_Esquie,"Mmmhmm. François was suuuper jealous, but he got one from Clea instead.",
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampScEsquie_Esquie,"Mon ami! Oho, you've put on a lot of weight.",
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampMsSciel_Sciel,Monoco seems fun.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampFbMaelle_Verso,Monoco’s a “Searcher.” They travel the land looking for gestrals who went missing after the Fracture.,
ST_DS_Camp/17_AftermathVersoSciel_Display,"Much to Verso’s surprise, his relationship with Sciel has not been affected by what he did.",
ST_DS_Camp/08_CampFbSciel_Sciel,My husband was obsessed with the idea of snow. I can’t wait to see some.,
ST_DS_Camp/10_CampMsSciel_Verso,Naturally.,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampScMaelle_Verso,Nevermind. Good night.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_AftermathLadies_Sciel,Nice hair.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampAct3BMaelle_Maelle,No poetry lately?,
ST_DS_Camp/09_CampEnSciel_Sciel,"No, but I could fill in the blanks.",
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampFbSciel_Sciel,"No, only in books and paintings. It’s almost as mythical as gestrals!",
ST_DS_Camp/09_AftermathVersoMaelle_Maelle,No.,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampMsMonoco_Monoco,Noco would’ve done the same for me.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampMsMonoco_Verso,Noco would’ve got Golgra on his side first.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampGvLune_Lune,Noco’s quite obsessed with your arm. Your apprentices would be extremely proud knowing a Gestral loves their work.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_Sisters_Maelle,Not a hard leap to make.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampFbEsquie_Verso,"Not just her, but yeah.",
ST_DS_Camp/01_AftermathMonoco_Monoco,"Not to say I told you so, but I do believe that I did in fact… tell you so.",
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampFbSciel_Verso,"Not too high but yeah, there’s usually snow.",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampAct3ASciel_Verso,Now it’s personal.,
ST_DS_Camp/09_CampA2Sciel_Sciel,"Of course I am, but…",
ST_DS_Camp/05_AftermathVersoSciel_Sciel,"Of course, you were wrong, but… oh well.",
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampMiSciel_Verso,Of killing the Paintress?,
ST_DS_Camp/13_AftermathVersoSciel_Sciel,"Oh please. I’d sacrifice you in a heartbeat to get him back, so… I understand. We’re good.",
ST_DS_Camp/12_CampScielEsquie_Esquie,"Oh yeah, me too. It’s fun.",
ST_DS_Camp/02_AftermathLadies_Maelle,"Oh yeah, that.",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampMsNoco_Verso,"Oh, I got your note about–",
ST_DS_Camp/05_AftermathVersoEsquie_Verso,"Oh, I know.",
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampEnEsquie_Esquie,"Oh, my best friend when he asked for my help!",
ST_DS_Camp/07_CampFbSciel_Sciel,"Oh, really?",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampFbSciel_Verso,"Oh, right, there’s no snow in Lumière.",
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampMsSciel_Verso,"Oh, yeah.",
ST_DS_Camp/08_CampScielEsquie_Esquie,"Oh, you mean the second time we met.",
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampScEsquie_Esquie,"Oh, “Maman's” the word! I promised.",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampA2Lune_Verso,"Oh. Actually, I should thank you. I wouldn’t have got this far on my own.",
ST_DS_Camp/24_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,Oh. I see.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampScEsquie_Esquie,Oho you know me! But now you’re here! We can go find them.,
ST_DS_Camp/25_CampScielEsquie_Esquie,Ohoho.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampMsEsquie_Esquie,"Ok, Momo is Momo and Nono is Nono.",
ST_DS_Camp/08_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel,"Ok, first lesson. Sounds obvious, but you need to see. Really see. Your eyes will tell you the truth, but your brain can lie.",
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampOlLune_Verso,"Ok, we’ll talk later then.",
ST_DS_Camp/12_CampMaelleSciel_Maelle,Ok.,
ST_DS_Camp/10_CampA1Esquie_Verso,"Okay yeah, uh… I see… It’s, uh… hard to control.",
ST_DS_Camp/09_CampMsLune_Verso,"Okay, you seem busy. I’ll come back later.",
ST_DS_Camp/16_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel,"On the field, it’s you, your weapon, and your enemy. You need to understand all three.",
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampA1Sciel_Sciel,"One down, one to go.",
ST_DS_Camp/01_AftermathVersoEsquie_Esquie,"Oooooh, everyone’s mad at you.",
ST_DS_Camp/12_AftermathVersoMaelle_Verso,Our whole world carries the burden of your family’s grief.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampMsEsquie_Verso,Positive.,
ST_DS_Camp/07_AftermathMonoco_Monoco,Quite a steep hill to climb.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampOlMaelle_Verso,Ready for the Axons?,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampA2Esquie_Verso,Really?,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampMsMaelle_Maelle,Really?,
ST_DS_Camp/09_CampMsSciel_Sciel,"Reigning Champion, naturally.",
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampAct3AEsquie_Esquie,Renoir is scary when he’s angry.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampMsMaelle_Verso,Ringing the bells makes the Nevrons flee.,
ST_DS_Camp/15_CampEnSciel_Gustave,Same.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_AftermathVersoSciel_Sciel,Save it.,
ST_DS_Camp/37_CampScielEsquie_Display,"Sciel and Esquie spend a long time together, as their friendship becomes unbreakable.",
ST_DS_Camp/A02_CampMaelleSciel_Display,"Sciel appears next to Maelle. They spend a moment in silence, both staring at the sky.",
ST_DS_Camp/00_CampScielEsquie_Display,Sciel approaches Esquie with something important to discuss.,
ST_DS_Camp/12_AftermathVersoSciel_Verso,Sciel…,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampA1Monoco_Monoco,Seems you were right about these Expeditioners. A most impressive group.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampAct3ALune_Lune,She has the power to remake our world. She’s a Paintress. But also our Maelle.,
ST_DS_Camp/10_Sisters_Verso,"She helped me before, I thought she’d help me again. But it seems she’s chosen a different side.",
ST_DS_Camp/06_Sisters_Verso,"She was trapped in a fire. A long time ago. Damaged her face and her throat, so, um– Yeah.",
ST_DS_Camp/05_Sisters_Verso,"She, uh–",
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampMiEsquie_Esquie,She’s going to be mad.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_VersoSelfMaelle_Verso,"She’s with the last Axon, west of the Monolith, at the top of the tower.",
ST_DS_Camp/07_CampMsNoco_Verso,Silly patate. Thanks.,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampAct3BLune_Lune,So I can see.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampEnMaelle_Gustave,So it seems.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_Sisters_Maelle,"So the masked person with Renoir, that’s your sister?",
ST_DS_Camp/16_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,So was I– was I swimming the first time we met?,
ST_DS_Camp/05_AftermathVersoLune_Verso,So you’d choose your expedition over your mother?,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampAct3AMonoco_Monoco,So. How are you going to win back their trust?,
ST_DS_Camp/09_CampA1Esquie_Esquie,Sometimes… I laugh too hard. I can’t control myself and…,
ST_DS_Camp/11_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,"Sorry, I’m– I’m quite lost.",
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampA2Maelle_Verso,Still thinking about what you saw?,
ST_DS_Camp/18_Sisters_Maelle,"Strangely, no. I hate secrets, but… Gustave always gave people the benefit of the doubt. And your actions are what matters. I trust you.",
ST_DS_Camp/28_CampScielEsquie_Esquie,Tears again. You sure do like to cry.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampScLune_Lune,Tell me about the Fracture.,
ST_DS_Camp/14_AftermathVersoSciel_Verso,Thank you.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampA2Lune_Lune,Thank you. Sciel was right about you.,
ST_DS_Camp/27_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,Thank you…,
ST_DS_Camp/02_AftermathMonoco_Verso,Thanks for the support.,
ST_DS_Camp/19_Sisters_Verso,Thanks.,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampMsSciel_Verso,"That obvious, huh?",
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampOlEsquie_Esquie,That was MEAN. I thought he cared! Renoir’s not being Renoir!,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampFbEsquie_Esquie,That was sad.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampMaelleSciel_Maelle,That white-haired bastard hit us before we even knew he was there. I want to return the favour. And you’re the best fighter I know.,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampAct3BMonoco_Monoco,That would be lovely.,
ST_DS_Camp/09_CampFbSciel_Verso,That you will.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_AftermathVersoLune_Lune,"That’s your problem, you think in false dichotomies. It wasn’t an “either / or” situation. Other solutions were possible, if you’d only trusted us enough to ask.",
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampMsMaelle_Maelle,"The Grandis are so gentle, who’s going to protect them while Monoco’s gone?",
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampFbMaelle_Maelle,The Lost Gestrals.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampMiEsquie_Esquie,The Paintress. She told me to stay away.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampSmLune2_Lune,The main continent. Hard to believe we’re finally here.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampA1Sciel_Verso,The next one will be harder.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampA1Lune_Verso,The odds of killing Axons. “Close. But not zero.”,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampMsNoco_Noco,The one I left in your hut! I took a special detour through Ancient Sanctuary just for you.,
ST_DS_Camp/10_CampMaelleLune_Lune,The pain we feel… everytime we lose someone…,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampAct3BEsquie_Esquie,The stones of the sea are my friends too.,
ST_DS_Camp/12_AftermathVersoLune_Display,"Their discussion has somewhat restored Lune’s trust in Verso. She understands him, even though she disagrees with him.",
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampMsEsquie_Esquie,"Then we’ve got Lulu, Maemae, and Scisci…",
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampMsMaelle_Verso,They can take care of themselves.,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampA1Monoco_Verso,They have.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_VersoSelfLune_Verso,They should be close to Sirène’s island.,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampAct3AMaelle_Maelle,They’re counting on me. I won’t abandon them. And I refuse to abandon you.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampOlSciel_Verso,They’re kind of tough.,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampMsMaelle_Verso,They’ve got their bells. Don’t worry.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampA1Monoco_Verso,"They’ve grown on you, haven’t they?",
ST_DS_Camp/14_AftermathLadies_Lune,This is a lot to take in.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampA1Esquie_Esquie,Those jellyfishes…,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampA1Esquie_Esquie,Those masks…,
ST_DS_Camp/18_CampMaelleSciel_Maelle,Thought this’d be more of a… technique lesson.,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampMiSciel_Sciel,To quote Lune. “Not zero.”,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampGobMaelle_Maelle,Told you Gestrals were real!,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampA2Lune_Lune,Tomorrow comes.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampMsEsquie_Verso,Uh…,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampFbEsquie_Verso,"Um, yeah.",
ST_DS_Camp/34_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,Um. No. But hopefully soon.,
ST_DS_Camp/15_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,"Um. Yes, I understand that.",
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampMaelleLune_Maelle,"Um… I, um… I didn’t mean…",
ST_DS_Camp/00_AftermathVersoMaelle_Display,Verso approaches Maelle. He does not know what she is thinking.,
ST_DS_Camp/00_AftermathMonoco_Display,"Verso approaches Monoco, expecting a lecture about what he has done.",
ST_DS_Camp/00_AftermathVersoSciel_Display,"Verso approaches Sciel, expecting her to be mad at him.",
ST_DS_Camp/00_AftermathVersoLune_Display,"Verso carefully approaches Lune, who looks furious.",
ST_DS_Camp/07_AftermathVersoEsquie_Display,Verso is relieved by Esquie’s reaction.,
ST_DS_Camp/08_AftermathMonoco_Display,Verso joins the others. His relationship with Monoco was not affected by his actions.,
ST_DS_Camp/30_CampScielEsquie_Esquie,Verso likes crying too.,
ST_DS_Camp/11_AftermathVersoLune_Display,"Verso walks away slowly, as he hears Lune sighing behind him.",
ST_DS_Camp/07_AftermathVersoMaelle_Maelle,Verso…,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampA2Esquie_Verso,"Wait, François has his own set of rocks? Why does he keep stealing yours then?",
ST_DS_Camp/20_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,"Wait, but how?",
ST_DS_Camp/07_CampFbEsquie_Esquie,Want a hug?,
ST_DS_Camp/30_CampMaelleLune_Lune,Want to know a secret? I have no idea what I’m doing. And I don’t think anyone else does either.,
ST_DS_Camp/A02_CampMaelleLune_Display,Wanting to apologise for her behaviour on their way to bury Gustave.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_AftermathMonoco_Monoco,Was it worth it?,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampA2Monoco_Verso,We are.,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampFbLune_Lune,We don’t get to enjoy such long friendships in Lumière.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampEnMaelle_Maelle,We finally found someone who loves rocks more than you.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_AftermathVersoMaelle_Maelle,We have to push Papa out of the Canvas before he erases everything.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_VersoSelfMonoco_Verso,We should go to the Sacred River. It’s not far from the station where we found Monoco.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_VersoSelfEsquie_Verso,We should revisit François.,
ST_DS_Camp/10_CampA2Sciel_Sciel,We will do everything in our power.,
ST_DS_Camp/16_Sisters_Maelle,"Wear it anyway. You said you chose your side, right?",
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampScSciel_Sciel,"Well, I don’t actively distrust you, either.",
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampGobMaelle_Maelle,"Well, I thought it!",
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampGvSciel_Sciel,"Well, it was a lot of fun so yeah, maybe?",
ST_DS_Camp/08_CampMsMaelle_Maelle,"Well, now I’m worried.",
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampGvLune_Lune,"Well, they did a great job designing your arm. It was quite a creative assignment you gave them.",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampGvLune_Gustave,"Well, when life gives you lemons…",
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampAct3AMonoco_Monoco,Well. At least everyone’s still talking to you. That’s a start!,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampAct3BLune_Lune,"Well. Since we mere mortals can’t leave this Canvas, Maelle has kindly offered to Paint the outside world for me.",
ST_DS_Camp/07_CampMiEsquie_Verso,We’re not going to be saying hello. You understand that right?,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampA1Esquie_Verso,What about them?,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampMiLune_Lune,What are we going to find when we walk through that door?,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampMiMonoco_Verso,What are you talking about? Why would I?,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampMsMaelle_Maelle,What do the bells do?,
ST_DS_Camp/13_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,What do you mean by “second time?”,
ST_DS_Camp/09_CampMaelleSciel_Maelle,What do you mean?,
ST_DS_Camp/13_CampMaelleLune_Maelle,What do you mean?,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampMsMonoco_Verso,What do you think?,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampMsNoco_Verso,What present?,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampGvSciel_Gustave,What was your plan if we hadn’t? Be a gestral champion until you Gommage?,
ST_DS_Camp/05_AftermathMonoco_Monoco,What will you do now?,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampAct3BLune_Lune,"What will you do, when this is all over? I’m having trouble imagining you living a “normal” life in Lumière.",
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampGvMaelle_Maelle,What?,
ST_DS_Camp/09_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,What?,
ST_DS_Camp/14_Sisters_Maelle,What?,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampMiEsquie_Verso,What? You never told me that. When was this?,
ST_DS_Camp/05_AftermathVersoMaelle_Maelle,What’s the alternative?,
ST_DS_Camp/04_Sisters_Maelle,"What’s wrong with her? She wears a mask all the time, she never talks, and she’s always staring.",
ST_DS_Camp/17_CampMaelleLune_Lune,"When I’m tired, when I feel hopeless, when I want to just let it all go…",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampEnSciel_Sciel,"When he said that, it made me think of… you know.",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampOlMonoco_Monoco,When the time is right. After we’ve settled this.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampEnEsquie_Gustave,When was the last time you saw a human?,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,"When we first met, what did you mean by “my terrible swimmer friend?”",
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampMiSciel_Sciel,Where do you put our chances now?,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampMiEsquie_Verso,Who?,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampFbLune_Verso,Why? Because he liked gestrals?,
ST_DS_Camp/08_Sisters_Maelle,Why… did they come to see me?,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampAct3ASciel_Verso,"Yeah, I can see that.",
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampEnSciel_Gustave,"Yeah, I thought it might.",
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampAct3BLune_Verso,"Yeah, I’m not sure I can live in a city anymore. I don’t know. What about you?",
ST_DS_Camp/09_CampMsMaelle_Verso,"Yeah, actually me too.",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampScEsquie_Verso,"Yeah, buddy, we’ll find them. Tell me… did you tell them about… you know what?",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampMsMonoco_Verso,"Yeah, but defying Golgra wasn’t Noco’s idea, was it?",
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampGvLune_Gustave,"Yeah, it’s not lemonade.",
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampAct3BSciel_Verso,"Yeah, one person…",
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampGvLune_Gustave,"Yeah, they’d be insanely excited.",
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampA2Lune_Verso,Yeah.,

ST_DS_Camp/02_CampA1Maelle_Verso,Yeah. He’s… hard to shake.,
ST_DS_Camp/08_CampFbEsquie_Verso,Yeah. I do.,
ST_DS_Camp/23_CampMaelleLune_Lune,Yeah. I do.,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampAct3ALune_Verso,Yeah. She’s our Maelle.,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampFbMaelle_Verso,"Yeah. That, and he pissed off Golgra.",
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampEnEsquie_Esquie,Yes!,
ST_DS_Camp/31_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,"Yes, I know…",
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampFbLune_Verso,"Yes, we’ve been friends for as long as I can remember.",
ST_DS_Camp/17_CampScielEsquie_Esquie,"Yes, you were. Before you stopped swimming in the middle of the ocean. That’s dangerous!",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampAct3BSciel_Sciel,Yes.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampMiMonoco_Monoco,You can still turn back.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampGobMaelle_Gustave,You did not.,
ST_DS_Camp/04_AftermathVersoSciel_Sciel,You did what you felt you had to.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampScSciel_Verso,You don’t trust me.,
ST_DS_Camp/22_CampMaelleLune_Maelle,You feel Gustave?,
ST_DS_Camp/16_AftermathVersoSciel_Verso,You got it.,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampMsSciel_Sciel,You guys getting us into more trouble now?,
ST_DS_Camp/25_CampMaelleLune_Lune,You have an affinity for chroma too. Try it.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampA1Maelle_Maelle,You have nightmares too? About Renoir?,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampMaelleSciel_Maelle,You know they’ll be back. I want to get them before they can get us.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampAct3BMonoco_Verso,"You miss Noco, don’t you?",
ST_DS_Camp/13_CampMaelleSciel_Sciel,"You need to see things as they are, not how you think they are. See your target, so you can understand your target.",
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampA2Monoco_Monoco,You ready?,
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampScLune_Verso,You really get straight to the point.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampMiMonoco_Monoco,"You said the Expeditioners have grown on me. Well I think they’ve grown on you too. In fact, I’d say you’re quite attached to them.",
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampScSciel_Sciel,You saved Maelle. That counts for quite a lot.,
ST_DS_Camp/19_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,You saved me. Back then.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampA2Sciel_Sciel,You seem preoccupied.,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampMsEsquie_Esquie,You sure you don’t wanna be Verver?,
ST_DS_Camp/33_CampScielEsquie_Esquie,You were looking for someone then. Did you find them?,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampA1Lune_Verso,You were right.,
ST_DS_Camp/03_CampFbEsquie_Esquie,You were sad.,
ST_DS_Camp/05_CampFbEsquie_Esquie,You were thinking of Julie?,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampA2Sciel_Verso,"You, on the other hand, seem quite relaxed.",
ST_DS_Camp/04_CampEnEsquie_Gustave,Your best friend is human? I thought François was your best friend?,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampFbLune_Lune,Your oldest friend is a gestral?,
ST_DS_Camp/06_CampScSciel_Verso,You’re an interesting group of Expeditioners.,
ST_DS_Camp/08_AftermathVersoMaelle_Verso,You’re fighting each other but you’re all doing the same thing.,
ST_DS_Camp/01_CampA2Monoco_Monoco,You’re finally here.,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampEnLune_Gustave,"You’re going to grill Esquie, aren’t you?",
ST_DS_Camp/09_AftermathLadies_Sciel,You’re not an orphan anymore. You just found your family. Don’t you want to be with them?,
ST_DS_Camp/08_CampA2Sciel_Verso,You’re not nervous?,
ST_DS_Camp/02_CampAct3AMonoco_Verso,"You’re really enjoying this, aren’t you?",
ST_DS_Camp/36_CampScielEsquie_Sciel,"You’re the best, mon ami.",

ST_DS_EsquieNest/06_PostFrancoisBattle_Maelle,But you can’t move…,
ST_DS_EsquieNest/04_PostFrancoisBattle_Esquie,"Hahahaha, ahh, François you got smashed.",
ST_DS_EsquieNest/01_PostFrancoisBattle_Francois,"Ok, let us put an end to this foolishness. I need to sleep. Like a turtle.",
ST_DS_EsquieNest/07_PostFrancoisBattle_Francois,SCRAM!,
ST_DS_EsquieNest/03_PostFrancoisBattle_Francois,"Take it, and never come back!",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/08_Golgra_Golgra,"A few of your expeditions, every few years. Hard to keep track.",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/10_Golgra_Lune,A white-haired man destroyed it.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/04_QuestKaratom_Gustave,Actually! I’ve been working on something for ya. Here.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/05_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,"Ah, you’ve found more journals! Excellent, excellent!",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/01_TournamentWinner_GestralAnnouncer,And the WINNER! Of the LEGENDARY TOURNAMENT! IS–,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/11_Golgra_Golgra,And you survived? My respect.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/03A_Golgra_Golgra,Are you the “Chef”?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/18_Golgra_Golgra,But only the greatest warriors are allowed through. You need a password.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/18_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,"Can’t wait to show this to Moshi, I’ve really missed that old gestral. Come back and visit sometime, will ya?",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/02_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,"Couldn’t find any more? Have you tried doing a bit of, I dunno, expeditioning?",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/03_QuestKaratom_Karatom,Did you lie??,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/38_Golgra_Golgra,Do you want to go to the arena directly or do you want to beat up a few gestrals around here first?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/21_Golgra_Golgra,Esquie doesn’t know its own strength sometimes.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/20_Golgra_Golgra,"Esquie is very friendly, but Esquie could also accidentally eat you.",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/05_PostGestralTournamentDS_Golgra,Esquie’s Nest is east of the Village. Sunniso guards that path.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/02_LegendaryTournament_Limonsol,Excellent! You may enter!,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/05_QuestKaratom_Gustave,Fix that on your Sakapatate.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/10_PostGestralTournamentDS_Maelle,Gestral positivity is so heart-warming.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/13_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,Get me {QuestItemCountToGive} more journals and I’ll show you something cool. There’s still about {QuestItemTotalCountToGive} journals to find.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/44_Golgra_Lune,Guess we have to enter the tournament now.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/13_Golgra_Golgra,He attacked the village once. Some of us survived. Somehow.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/09_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,Here’s a little something to perk up your day. Ol’ Moshi’s gonna be thrilled with all these journals.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/01_QuestKaratom_Karatom,Hey you!,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/08_QuestKaratom_Maelle,He’s… Gone…,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/09_Golgra_Golgra,Hmm. Do you not have your own boat? How did you get here in the first place?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/03_Golgra_Golgra,Hmmm. I see. Well. You’ve earned my respect. What can I do for you?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/06_Golgra_Golgra,Humans. Still so obsessed with the Paintress.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/03B_Golgra_Golgra,I am indeed the “Chef” of our village.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/15_Golgra_Golgra,"If you ask nicely, maybe Esquie can take you across the water.",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/02_Golgra_Maelle,It wasn’t that strong.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/22_Golgra_Golgra,It would be irresponsible to let weaklings visit Esquie.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/12_PostGestralTournamentDS_Golgra,It’ll be easier to come back and visit us.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/16_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,"I’m saving a prettttty awesome reward for you, if you collect {QuestItemCountToGive} more journals. There’s {QuestItemTotalCountToGive} total still out there.",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/43_Golgra_Lune,Lead the way.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/15_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,"Let me see, hmmm, yes, there’s still {QuestItemTotalCountToGive} journals missing. How ‘bout this, bring me {QuestItemCountToGive} more and I’ll give you something interesting.",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/11_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,"Lovely bits of writing this! Ahhh, yes I know just the perfect reward. It’s very special.",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/14_Golgra_Golgra,"Mmm. Ok. You have no boat. In that case, your best bet is Esquie.",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/07_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,"New journals, eh? Let’s see ‘em!",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/04_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,No new journals? Are you sure you really looked?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/24_Golgra_Golgra,Not. Good. Enough.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/01_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,"Nothin’ new? You ain’t looking very hard, are ya?",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/29G_Golgra_Golgra,Now I’m excited. Let's see what you can do.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/17_Golgra_Golgra,Of course! Esquie lives not far from here.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/29H_Golgra_Golgra,"Oh and you'll also fight the Stranger. Yeah, that will be fun.",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/06_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,"Oho, I sense new journals on ya!",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/09_QuestKaratom_Karatom,Oh…,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/37_Golgra_Golgra,"Okay, enough talk. Go fight now.",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/11_PostGestralTournamentDS_Golgra,One more thing. We’ve opened the back door for you.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/07_Golgra_Lune,Others have passed through here?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/06_PostGestralTournamentDS_Golgra,Shout the password as loud as you can and Sunniso will let you through.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/16_Golgra_Lune,So Esquie exists!,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/01_Golgra_Golgra,So YOU’RE the warriors who demolished our ULTIMATE Sakapatate?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/40_Golgra_Lune,Take us to the arena.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/08_PostGestralTournamentDS_Gustave,Thank you. For everything.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/13_PostGestralTournamentDS_Sciel,Thanks Chef.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/42_Golgra_Golgra,That's the Gestral spirit.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/30_Golgra_Lune,The Stranger?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/03C_Golgra_Golgra,The name’s Golgra.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/03_PostGestralTournamentDS_Maelle,The password is “get outta my way?”,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/04_Golgra_Lune,There are so many questions I’d love to ask–,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/12_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,"These expeditioners sure had some wild adventures, didn’t they? I got something wild for you too.",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/29D_Golgra_Golgra,They are old so it should be easy.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/02_TournamentWinner_GestralAnnouncer,This Person! Whose name I can’t remember!,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/29B_Golgra_Golgra,This is the Gestral way.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/09_PostGestralTournamentDS_Golgra,Try not to die too soon.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/04_PostGestralTournamentDS_Sciel,Very gestral-ish.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/41_Golgra_Golgra,Very well. The Arena is on the other side of the village when you're ready.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/29E_Golgra_Lune,Wait a minute…,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/23_Golgra_Maelle,We already defeated your Ultimate Sakapatate.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/05_Golgra_Gustave,We need to get to the Paintress. Noco said you could help us cross the sea?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/39_Golgra_Lune,We'll… look around first.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/10_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,Well now! That’s a GREAT addition to our collection. You deserve something extra. Here ya go!,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/08_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,Whaddya got for me this time?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/02_QuestKaratom_Karatom,What about the arm?? You were gonna help me build the BEST SAKAPATATE.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/29F_Golgra_Lune,What is this tournament?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/07_QuestKaratom_Karatom,Where’s the man with the arm? He promised to help me.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/17_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,"Whooohoo! I can’t believe ya did it, you found all the journals out there. Ol’ Moshi’s gonna be SO damn happy. Noco was right, y’all really are spectacular. You deserve the ULTIMATE reward.",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/01_LegendaryTournament_Limonsol,Who’s it gonna be? Which of you shall fight for GLORY in the Legendary Tournament?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/19_Golgra_Maelle,Why?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/06_QuestKaratom_Karatom,Wow.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/03_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,You didn’t find any? Have you considered glasses?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/12_Golgra_Lune,You know him?,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/01_PostGestralTournamentDS_Golgra,"You return as champions! Well done, well done. Ok then, you ready? The password is–",
ST_DS_GestralVillage/29C_Golgra_Golgra,You will be fighting our Legendary Warriors.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/29A_Golgra_Golgra,You'll have to enter our Legendary Tournament to get the password.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/14_BerramiDialogue_Berrami,{QuestItemTotalCountToGive} journals left to go! I’ve got a special gift if you can find another {QuestItemCountToGive} journals.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/07_PostGestralTournamentDS_Sciel,“As loud as we can.” Got it.,
ST_DS_GestralVillage/02_PostGestralTournamentDS_Golgra,“Get outta my way.”,
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_Quizmaster_Gustave,100 years ago.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_Quizmaster_Gustave,33 years ago.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_Quizmaster_Gustave,67 years ago.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/18_Cyril_Cyril,A headline about the Expedition… That's bold.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/17_Cyril_Cyril,A headline about the contrast of beauty and death…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_TrashcanMan_Display,A perfectly normal trash can.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/26_Quizmaster_Gustave,A special type of weapon.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalBastien_Gustave,A view of the Paintress? You’re sicker than I thought.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_Mime_Display,A weird mime is standing here.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/25_Quizmaster_Gustave,Abilities you internalise by using a Pictos in battle after enough times.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_MaelleSophie_Maelle,About you too. I always told him you two should never have broken up.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_TrashcanMan_TrashcanMan,"Actually, I am Gommaging like everyone else, looks like my plan didn't work.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalCatherine_Gustave,"Actually, no.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_Cyril_Cyril,Actually…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_FestivalApprentices_Gustave,Adrien?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_Quizmaster_Gustave,"After tomorrow, you’ll be the undisputed expert on Expedition history.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_FestivalTristan_Gustave,"Ah right, you were both apprenticed to her parents.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_TutorialOutcomes_Maelle,"Ah, Emma’s here. Your sister’s going to be looking for you.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_Cyril_Cyril,"Ah, the scintillating Sophie!",
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_FestivalSciel_Gustave,Ah.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_ArtefactLady_Gustave,Ah. I should’ve known.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalLucien_Lucien,Ah. The ultimate indignity. A farewell party where we serve ourselves. There’s a metaphor in there somewhere.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_PictosTrader_Tom,"Aha! Back for my pictos masterpiece, eh?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/31_Quizmaster_Antoine,"Ahem. I hereby officially end our feud. With your departure, Lumière loses a brilliant light. And a… good friend.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/17_Quizmaster_Antoine,"All right, fine, another one then.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_MaelleFirstDuel_Gustave,"All right, let's see what you've got.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_MaelleFirstDuel_Maelle,"All right, now let's go find Sophie.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_Eloise_Eloise,All they do is leave us here to die. They're just escaping.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/33_Quizmaster_Antoine,"Alright alright, here’s a token, go spend it on something.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/21_MaelleDuel_Maelle,"Alright, enough chit chat. C’mon old man, let’s have a duel.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/24_MaelleDuel_Gustave,"Alright, you’re on.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/27_Nicolas_Nicolas,"Also take this, as a gesture of appreciation. I see your ""not boyfriend"" is an Expeditioner. It may prove useful.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/08A_Hairstylist_Display,Amandine tries to experiment with Gustave's hair.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_FestivalLucien_Lucien,And I AM prepared! Prepared to live. AND. Prepared to die.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalApprentices_Alexandre,And Nevrons!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_Eloise_Eloise,And here we are again this year.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_Marie_Sophie,And it destroyed my relationship with the person I loved the most.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_Ulysse_Ulysse,And me and my little brother will live with the Gestrals and they'll be our new family.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_Marie_Marie,And yet you didn't have children…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_Marie_Sophie,And you should cherish this moment with your daughter.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_Richard_Richard,And… My son and I had a fight last night.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_MaelleFirstDuel_Maelle,"And… if you win, I'll give you something you can use with your Lumina Converter.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalFlorian_Gustave,Another one of these Paintress worshippers. Best to ignore him.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_Richard_Sophie,Anything for my beloved sewing teacher.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/19_FestivalEmma_Emma,"Anyway. Yeah, time for my speech.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/22_Quizmaster_Antoine,Are you even trying? It’s barely a trick question. One more time.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_FestivalLune_Lune,"Assuming the records are correct, my calculations are correct, that they left clear markers, that the road conditions haven’t changed–",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_Cyril_Cyril,"Beautiful and perceptive, per usual.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_Eloise_Eloise,Before he left for Expedition 34.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/17_MaelleDuel_Maelle,"Besides, this way I can keep an eye on you for Emma.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_Estelle_Estelle,Brilliant.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/15_Quizmaster_Antoine,Brilliant. I concede. You are the undisputed expert on Lumieran History.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalLucien_Lucien,Bring Gustave a glass of wine!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_TrashcanMan_TrashcanMan,"But I have a strategy, if I hide inside here the Paintress won't think of Gommaging me.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_MaelleSophie_Sophie,"But I have hope that you and Gustave will change things, so no one has to go through this impossible choice again.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/19_Estelle_Estelle,But I will.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalVictor_Victor,"But Maelle! Quite the ballsy one, eh? No looking back for her. Bet she can’t wait to get outta here.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_Tiffanie_Tiffanie,But he is too.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_Nicolas_Nicolas,But it is this passion I so fiercely desire in my painting.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalJerome_Jerome,But not impossible.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_PictosTrader_Gustave,Call it morbid curiosity. Here. Your token.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/29_Nicolas_Nicolas,Can you do it? Can you show me a dance of love and sorrow?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_TrashcanMan_TrashcanMan,Can you leave? I don't want to draw attention to myself.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_Hairstylist_Gustave,Certainly important. Can you style me up too?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_ArtefactLady_Gustave,"Colette, you’ve been holding out on us. What are these?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_HotelLove_LifeEnjoyer,Come on you've been listening for too long now!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_MaelleFirstDuel_Maelle,"Come on, it'll loosen you up. You can't go and see Sophie all sombre and tense.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_RooftopsEnd_Maelle,"Come on, she's down there. It's your moment.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FlowerReminder_Maelle,"Come on, you're not going to forget your flower here, are you?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalMichel_Michel,"Come, let’s play some cards.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalAlan_Gustave,Commander.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_TutorialOutcomes_Maelle,"Congratulations, you beat a teenager. Take this token as your well deserved prize.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/23_Quizmaster_Antoine,"Correct. That still annoys me. They left in Year 100. They should be called Expedition 100. Makes no sense. Lumière will be long gone before the Monolith hits zero. Alright, last one. Get it right and maybe I’ll give you a token.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_Henri_Sophie,"Could be useful though, the Expeditions rely on them quite heavily.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_Richard_Richard,Could you bring it to him?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/16_Cyril_Sophie,Cyril really needs to take his job seriously.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_Cyril_Sophie,"Cyril, you flatterer. Need some help with your writing again?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_Jules_Jules,Dad…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_Jules_Jules,Dad…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_Jules_Jules,"Damn, now I feel stupid for fighting with him…",
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_Mime_Sophie,Did someone build this?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/18_Nicolas_Nicolas,Did you change your mind?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_Marie_Marie,Do you care so little about the future of Lumière? How can you be so selfish.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/23_Eloise_Eloise,Do you think… I should join the Expedition?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_FestivalLucie_Gustave,Do you?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/16_FestivalAlan_Gustave,Doesn’t it always.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/24_Cyril_Sophie,Don't forget to credit me.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/17_Richard_Sophie,"Don't worry, I'll ask Gustave.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_TutorialOutcomes_Maelle,Don’t get too drunk tonight okay?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_FestivalLucien_Lucien,Don’t worry buddy. I’ve got you covered.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/15_FestivalEmma_Gustave,Don’t you have a speech to give?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/20_MaelleDuel_Gustave,"Doubly lucky, since now I have two.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalJerome_Gustave,Doubtful. We would’ve seen signs.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/15_TrashcanMan_TrashcanMan,"During my time in this trash can, I found a rare treasure. I am entrusting it to you now.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalLucie_Lucie,D’you think I’m a coward for staying?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_Henri_Henri,"Eh, they're crazy too. But at least you can remove Pictos pretty easily if you change your mind.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_FestivalCatherine_Catherine,Eh.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_FestivalEmma_Gustave,"Em. You’re doing great work– Really. Getting things ready for the Last Generation- You’ve got it well in-hand here. Let me do my part, out there, and win us a chance to LIVE.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/15_MaelleDuel_Gustave,Emma thinks of you as family–,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_Ulysse_Ulysse,Even if it means joining an Expedition!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/19_Quizmaster_Gustave,Expedition 100.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/15_Cyril_Sophie,Expedition 33 shall be the destined journey.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/20_Quizmaster_Gustave,Expedition 99.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/21_Quizmaster_Gustave,Expedition Zero.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/15_Nicolas_Nicolas,"Fantastic. You may start. Here, gorgeous lady, take this paintbrush and show me your wrath.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/16_TrashcanMan_TrashcanMan,Farewell.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/19_Richard_Sophie,For this moment… maybe.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalApprentices_Guillaume,"For your field notes. So when you come back, you can tell us EVERYTHING.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_FestivalMaxime_Maxime,Forget it. “Bon voyage.”,
ST_DS_Lumiere/28_Eloise_Eloise,"Give this to your boyfriend, my father gave it to me, but it might be more useful for him.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalLucien_Lucien,Glass of wine? Or a hug?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_FestivalLune_Lune,"Go away, Gustave.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_Hairstylist_Amandine,"Go find a token first, I’ll save your spot in the queue.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/23_FestivalSciel_Sciel,Go have some drinks.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/18_Marie_Sophie,"Good luck, Marie.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_Ophelie_Ophelie,Good luck… My friend.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_PictosTrader_Tom,"Great, I’ll trade it for one token.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/15_FestivalLucien_Gustave,Great. Thanks buddy.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_Mime_Display,Gustave destroyed the weird mime.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_Jules_Display,Gustave give Jules the uniform that his father made for him.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalSeba_Seba,Gustave! Come drink with me!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalApprentices_Alexandre,Gustave! We got something for you.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_Mime_Sophie,"Gustave, help!",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_Quizmaster_Antoine,"Gustave, just the man I wanted to see.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalAlan_Alan,Gustave.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/18_Richard_Richard,Gustave? Are you back together?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/15_Eloise_Sophie,Gustave? Why don't you show her some of your fighting skills to prove her wrong?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_Tiffanie_Sophie,Has everybody already left?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_Richard_Richard,He said he wants to join the expedition… He wants to waste the last year of his life.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/15_Richard_Richard,"He won't join the Gommage ceremony, but he will be at the Expedition Festival tonight for sure.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_ArtefactLady_Colette,"Hello there, Gustave. Perhaps one of these artefacts may prove useful to your mission?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_Cyril_Cyril,"Help me again, Sophie, please. My boss will kill me…",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_Hairstylist_Gustave,"Hey Amandine, having fun?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_PictosTrader_Tom,"Hey Gustave, check out the new Pictos I made!",
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_Ulysse_Ulysse,"Hey madame, do you think the gestrals really exist?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_TrashcanMan_TrashcanMan,Hey you! You've been here for quite a while now!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalCatherine_Catherine,Hey yourself.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_Estelle_Estelle,"Hey, you.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalCatherine_Gustave,Hey.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalTristan_Tristan,Hey. Does Lune seem preoccupied to you? She’s been distant lately.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_FestivalLucien_Lucien,Hey. Heyheyheyheyhey. We’ve got your Lumina Converter yeah? I. BELIEVE. I’m ready for my Lumina!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_Ophelie_Ophelie,Hi Gustave. You’re back. Did you want to pick out a different flower?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_Cyril_Sophie,"Hm, true.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_Tiffanie_Sophie,"Hm, yeah, he did.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_MaelleFirstDuel_Maelle,Hmm…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_MaelleFirstDuel_Gustave,Hmm…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_Eloise_Eloise,Hm…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_Nicolas_Nicolas,Hm…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_Estelle_Estelle,How could I make it better?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_MaelleSophie_Sophie,How kind of you.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_Quizmaster_Antoine,How many years ago was the Fracture?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_Nicolas_Nicolas,I am also the official painter of the Opera.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_Marie_Sophie,I am not selfish enough to bring others into our doomed world.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_FestivalApprentices_Gustave,"I can do that. And in return, do you solemnly promise to take care of the Shield Dome while I’m gone? I’m entrusting you with the safety of Lumière.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalLune_Gustave,I can’t believe you’re working right now.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_FestivalMaxime_Maxime,I can’t. I can’t look at her. She’s just another reminder that nothing we do matters. Nothing. We hope and we ”persevere” and still they die. They all die and we can’t stop it. We can’t save them. We bring another generation into this world just so they can watch us die before they’re even old enough to understand why.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_Richard_Richard,I could recognize it from miles away.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_Marie_Marie,I didn't know about… I thought you were younger.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/18_FestivalEmma_Emma,I do. Understand. I just–,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_FestivalRaphael_Raphael,"I dunno, kinda nice in a way, having a “deadline.” Forces you to prioritise. It’s a bit freeing, as we get closer to the end.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalJerome_Jerome,I dunno. People are resourceful. And Nevrons can’t be everywhere. I’m betting on human ingenuity.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/25_Nicolas_Sophie,"I feel it wasn't that impressive, but… okay.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_MaelleSophie_Maelle,I guess I can relate…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_Ophelie_Ophelie,"I have a garland saved for you, too. But it’s not a farewell garland. It will be a welcome home garland.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_Eloise_Eloise,I have no future. I know it and I've accepted it. We're doomed.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalTristan_Gustave,"I haven’t noticed anything, but you know her better. Have you talked to her?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalTristan_Tristan,I just finished calibrating the Lumina converter. We can launch test runs as soon as we land.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_Estelle_Estelle,I just finished my sculpture of the legendary Esquie.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_Tiffanie_Tiffanie,I just wish you didn't have to wear one.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_MaelleDuel_Gustave,I knew I’d find you here. Having second thoughts about the Expedition?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_Tiffanie_Tiffanie,I knew he would.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/29_Eloise_Eloise,I knew it. Expeditioners are weak. This year will be like all the others.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_Estelle_Estelle,I knew you were the right person to ask. Thank you for your insight!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_Richard_Richard,I know I made a mistake. I tried to impose my views on him when he is much braver than I will ever be.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_Tiffanie_Sophie,I know that…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_Marie_Sophie,I know we are not many to think like this now…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_MaelleDuel_Gustave,"I know we’ve been over this, but as your guardian, I need to say this one more time.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_MaelleFirstDuel_Maelle,I know what you need! A little duel!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_MaelleDuel_Gustave,I know you think that but–,
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_Nicolas_Nicolas,"I know, how about showing me a dance of love and sorrow?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalSeba_Gustave,I like that you say “when” and not “if.”,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_FestivalJerome_Gustave,I like that.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_ArtefactLady_Colette,"I may not be able to join the Expedition, but I’d still like to help. One token is all I ask.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_Nicolas_Nicolas,"I need inspiration… But you… I can see you're in love. With this fine gentleman, I suppose.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_ArtefactLady_Gustave,I need to think about it.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_FestivalApprentices_Alexandre,I promise.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_Marie_Sophie,I said. Not today.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/15_MaelleFirstDuel_Maelle,I saw her near the red and white tree.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_Estelle_Estelle,I see you're wearing flowers.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_Estelle_Estelle,"I see, something that induces fear to attract attention…",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalApprentices_Gustave,I shall faithfully record ALL of our adventures. Every strange and wondrous thing.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_Estelle_Estelle,I shall get to work tomorrow.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/16_Tiffanie_Tiffanie,I should finish cleaning up here and join everyone at the harbour.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalRaphael_Raphael,I think he prefers “We’re already dead. You’re just catching up.”,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalLune_Gustave,I trust your calculations.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_TrashcanMan_TrashcanMan,I turned 33 today can you believe my luck? Why would my parents choose the worst time…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_Richard_Richard,"I used to think it was a bad choice, but today, I no longer do.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_Jules_Jules,I want to support the Expedition now. Take it. It may be useful to you.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/20_Nicolas_Nicolas,I was so enthralled that I completed the painting in an instant.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalLucie_Lucie,I wasn’t sure if I should.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/24_Nicolas_Nicolas,I will propose it for the new Opera painting we have to do this year.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/25_Cyril_Cyril,I would never.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalSciel_Gustave,I wouldn’t dare. Just calculating how much it’ll hurt to catch up.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_HotelLove_LifeEnjoyer,"I'll give you this, and you leave okay? Just go do it together!",
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_Ulysse_Ulysse,I'll raise a Gestral army and we'll crush the Paintress!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_Henri_Henri,"I'll stick to painting Pictos on my machines, I'm not cuckoo enough to put them on my body.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_Ulysse_Sophie,I'm afraid they're just fairytales.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/20_Eloise_Sophie,I'm content with my life. I know what I can and cannot change.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/20_Richard_Richard,I'm glad… He is a good person.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_Marie_Sophie,I'm not having this conversation with you again.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_Jules_Jules,"I'm not sure I'll ever use it. Maybe I'll go blind like my father, or maybe another expedition will succeed.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_MaelleSophie_Maelle,I'm volunteering to help guide children who are losing their parents to the orphanage. Those who were not registered for foster families...,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_TrashcanMan_TrashcanMan,I've been hiding for six months now. So leave and don't tell anyone I'm here!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_MaelleDuel_Maelle,"If anyone should stay, it’s you. You have friends and family who want you here–",
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_Ulysse_Ulysse,"If the legends are true, they really like to fight.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_FestivalBastien_Gustave,If we– If we fail though…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_FestivalLucie_Gustave,If you say so.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_Nicolas_Sophie,In love?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_MaelleSophie_Maelle,In the next life.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_Eloise_Sophie,Is something wrong?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalLune_Gustave,Is that the final spot? It’s amazing you triangulated Expedition Zero’s landing site.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/23_Nicolas_Nicolas,It is I who should thank you. It was a moving dance.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_TrashcanMan_Display,It is indeed a perfectly normal trash can.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_HotelLove_LifeEnjoyer,It made things more exciting at first but now it's awkward!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_FestivalLucie_Gustave,"It makes me sad to hear you talk like this. The Paintress stole so many things, including your capacity to dream.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/28_Cyril_Sophie,"It's always been a pleasure, my friend.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_Richard_Richard,It's good you're here Sophie. I have a favor to ask of you.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08B_Hairstylist_Display,It's looking good.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/21_Nicolas_Sophie,It's nice… to know something of us will remain in the world after today.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_Jules_Jules,It's ok. I dont need the uniform to know my dad's with me.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_FestivalLune_Gustave,"It’s a good strategy, retracing their steps. They’re the only expedition with any survivors, and they made it to the Monolith so…",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_PictosTrader_Tom,"It’s dead useful, trust me. C’mon, give it a whirl.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_FestivalCatherine_Catherine,It’s for the best. I need full focus on the Expedition. And our team. We’re all we have.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_Quizmaster_Antoine,"It’s my last chance, isn’t it?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_FestivalAlan_Alan,It’s ok. She doesn’t need to understand. As long as she gets to live.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalMathilde_Gustave,It’s ok. Thanks.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalMathilde_Gustave,I’ll drink to that. Thanks for catering.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_FestivalApprentices_Adrien,"I’ll use everything you taught us, Monsieur G.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_FestivalAlan_Alan,I’m counting on you.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_Ophelie_Ophelie,I’m glad. These garlands are our last farewell. I want them all to feel special.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalSeba_Gustave,I’m pacing myself tonight.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_FestivalAlan_Gustave,"I’m– Thanks, but– That’s not– Everyone has a role. Lucien, Tristan, Catherine. And YOU. You made us into a–",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalBastien_Bastien,I’ve already claimed Alan’s office. It’s got a nicer view than mine.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_PictosTrader_Tom,I’ve been working on this for months. It’s my personal masterpiece.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalEmma_Gustave,I’ve heard you say otherwise.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_RooftopsEnd_Maelle,I… Good luck. I'll be here for you if things… don't go as planned.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_Richard_Richard,I… I didn't want that for him.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/25_Eloise_Eloise,I… I don't want to have regrets… I don't have that much time…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_Richard_Richard,I… We are of the same cohort. Today is my Gommage.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/17_FestivalEmma_Gustave,Just suggestions! I thought it might help you understand–,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_FestivalEmma_Emma,"Just take care of Maelle, ok? I can’t believe you’re letting her go with you.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalLucien_Gustave,Keep your sweat to yourself.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalMathilde_Mathilde,Least I can do is provide a good last meal.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_Mime_Sophie,Let's leave it alone Gustave! It's dangerous!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_Hairstylist_Gustave,Let’s see what you got.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_MaelleSophie_Sophie,Look at these orphans that's… That's where we disagreed.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_PictosTrader_Gustave,Looks a bit rough. You sure it works?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_Tiffanie_Sophie,Looks like you still have a lot of flowers left.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/26_Nicolas_Nicolas,Love will always be impressive.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/16_MaelleDuel_Maelle,Lumière’s not my home. Not the way it is for you.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/27_Quizmaster_Gustave,Lumière’s unique brand of perfume.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalAlan_Alan,Léona’s upset. Doesn’t want to see me.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_Marie_Sophie,Marie…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalVictor_Victor,"Mate, I wish I was going with ya! If we could just send a bigger force! Get ALL of Lumière to just throw EVERYTHING we got at the bloody Paintress. Ahhh, but my brother would kill me. His number’s up soon, and I’m guardian for his kid.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_FestivalMaxime_Gustave,Maxime.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalMaxime_Gustave,Maxime. You’re drunk.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalJerome_Jerome,Maybe if they have Shield Domes. But they would’ve been overrun by Nevrons before they could build any.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_Quizmaster_Gustave,Maybe later?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_Estelle_Sophie,Maybe sculpt something more menacing… like a Nevron.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_TrashcanMan_TrashcanMan,Maybe you can use it?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/15_Jules_Jules,Maybe you'll win and I won't need it back. Or maybe I'll reclaim it off your dead bodies during my Expedition!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/19_Eloise_Sophie,Me?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_FestivalEmma_Gustave,Me? You’re her guardian too. You stop her.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_FestivalLucie_Gustave,Meaning what? Make yourself accept the unacceptable? Make believe that happiness is… this?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalMichel_Michel,"Meh. We’re EXPEDITIONERS. Stay smart, yes, but be BOLD, eh? You can’t win if you don’t play.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalLucie_Lucie,Mm. I heard Seba filled my spot. After I left.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalTristan_Tristan,Mm. This feels different.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalLune_Lune,Mm. Tristan dragged me here.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_FestivalBastien_Gustave,Mmm.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_FestivalTristan_Gustave,Mmm. I can imagine.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalLucien_Gustave,Mmm. I’m betting you’ve got another bottle stashed in your coat somewhere. You gonna share?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_FestivalSciel_Sciel,Mmm. “Tomorrow Comes” but it ain’t here yet. I’m not crossing the sea sober.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalMichel_Gustave,Money’s no good out there anyway. Why’re you trying to fleece me?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_FestivalLucie_Lucie,More like… rediscover. Happiness. One Gommage left. Maybe contentment is the highest form of happiness.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_TrashcanMan_TrashcanMan,"Move on, the Paintress must not know I'm here.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_Ulysse_Ulysse,My Gestral costume is the best!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/24_Eloise_Sophie,"My friend Sciel always says, do your best, either it works or it doesn't. Live your life as you want.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_Nicolas_Nicolas,My inspiration has been quite lacking recently.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_Hairstylist_Gustave,"Nah, I’m good, but thanks.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalVictor_Victor,"Nah, hesitation was never her style.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_FestivalTristan_Tristan,"Nah, she doesn’t like people prying. I’ve known her since we were six. She hates personal questions.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_Henri_Henri,"Nah, the show's great, but etching chroma onto your skin? Oof, that's brutal. And just for a dance?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_FestivalAlan_Gustave,No pressure.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalMichel_Gustave,No way. Everyone knows you cheat.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_FestivalRaphael_Raphael,"No, it’s just– Things don’t always work out the way we want. No use getting upset, ya know? Use what we can. Leave what we can’t.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_FestivalSciel_Sciel,"No, not for that.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_Ophelie_Gustave,"No, the one you suggested earlier was perfect.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_FestivalLucie_Lucie,"No, you misunderstand. My mind is where I can be free. She can’t touch me there. This is my final act of defiance. Just like the Expedition is yours.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalMathilde_Mathilde,"No, ‘course not. Sorry. I just meant–",
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_MaelleFirstDuel_Gustave,No.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_MaelleDuel_Maelle,No. I don’t.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalRaphael_Raphael,No?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_Nicolas_Nicolas,Nobody buys paintings anymore… Just because she is called The Paintress doesn't mean painting is evil.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/21_Cyril_Cyril,Nobody really cares about them anymore after their constant failures. But that would make a wonderful underdog story.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalMaxime_Maxime,None of you ever come back. You go and you take our resources and you waste it all. On a fucked up hero adrenaline fantasy. And still. SHE kills us.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_PictosTrader_Gustave,Not a chance.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_FestivalLucie_Lucie,Not anymore. Not all of us can change the world. Some of us can only change ourselves.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_TutorialOutcomes_Gustave,"Not bad for the oldest man in Lumière, eh?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_HotelLove_Sophie,Not everyone attends the Living Wake or goes to the Harbour for the Gommage.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalVictor_Gustave,Not much hesitation on her part.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_Nicolas_Nicolas,Not quite. I am only in love with her art.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/30_Quizmaster_Gustave,"Not really. I mean, I created the Lumina Converter… So…?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_Marie_Sophie,Not today.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_TrashcanMan_Display,"Nothing special to see here, just a trash can.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_TutorialOutcomes_Gustave,Now don’t get too confident.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_Marie_Sophie,"Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to spend this moment with him.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_Ulysse_Sophie,Of course they do!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_Richard_Sophie,Of course. I'll bring it to Jules.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_Richard_Richard,"Oh Sophie, what a lovely smell.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalApprentices_Guillaume,"Oh and if you find journals from the other Expeditions, make sure you save them for us!",
ST_DS_Lumiere/19_Cyril_Cyril,Oh come on! I really need your help!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_Hairstylist_Amandine,"Oh hey handsome, perfect timing. I’m styling everyone before we ship out. Gotta look sharp when we hit the Paintress, eh?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_FestivalApprentices_Alexandre,"Oh hey, Gustave, your sister’s here!",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_MaelleSophie_Maelle,Oh hi Sophie.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_Tiffanie_Tiffanie,Oh hi Sophie.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/16_Richard_Richard,"Oh, but you…",
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_FestivalAlan_Alan,"Oh, no. LOTS of pressure. You and Lune and your Lumina tech. That’s our edge.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_FestivalCatherine_Catherine,"Oh, that was over ages ago.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/18_Estelle_Sophie,"Oh, you don't have to.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalSeba_Seba,"Oh, you’re so boring. It’s our last night! Who knows when we’ll be back.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_FestivalCatherine_Gustave,Oh. Sorry–,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_MaelleSophie_Sophie,Oh? Maelle? I didn't expect to see you here.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_Marie_Marie,Oh… Sophie.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/16_Nicolas_Sophie,"Okay, I guess.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/22_Cyril_Cyril,"Okay, now I'm inspired.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_MaelleFirstDuel_Maelle,"Okay, you may have lost, but… don't you feel better? I see that smile.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_Hairstylist_Amandine,On it. Just bring me a token first.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_TrashcanMan_Display,"Once again, a perfectly normal–",
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_Ulysse_Ulysse,"One day, I will meet one.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_ArtefactLady_Colette,One token is all I ask. Come back when you have one.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_MaelleDuel_Maelle,One year out there’s better than nine years in here.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/21_Eloise_Sophie,Or maybe... Because I was afraid.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_FestivalLucien_Lucien,Or was it “Always bring backup?” Eh. Same difference.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_TutorialOutcomes_Gustave,"Our beloved Chief Councilor. Yeah, I should go talk to her.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_TrashcanMan_TrashcanMan,Ow! What's that? It's hurting my ass.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_Estelle_Estelle,Paint it? Hmm…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalTristan_Gustave,Perfect.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_Estelle_Sophie,Perhaps you could paint it? Add some colour?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_MaelleDuel_Maelle,Please. I’m more ready to go than you are.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_FestivalApprentices_Guillaume,Promise!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_Ulysse_Ulysse,"Prove it. You can't, can you?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalMathilde_Mathilde,"Quite the party. Well, quality over quantity, eh? Story of our lives.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalBastien_Bastien,Ready for tomorrow?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_Hairstylist_Amandine,Ready for your new haircut?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_Quizmaster_Antoine,"Really, Gustave? I gave you such an easy question! Come on, try again.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_ArtefactLady_Colette,"Relics from before the Fracture, passed down through the generations. The Council deemed them trinkets, but I think otherwise.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/18_MaelleDuel_Gustave,"Right, ‘cause she needs eyes everywhere.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_FestivalLucien_Gustave,Right.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalAlan_Alan,Saw you with Sophie. You talked?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/17_Marie_Marie,See you at the harbour.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_MaelleSophie_Sophie,See you.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/17_Tiffanie_Tiffanie,See you.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/23_Richard_Sophie,See you.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/18_Tiffanie_Sophie,See you…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_Cyril_Cyril,"See, I'm preparing the headline for tomorrow, and who could write it better than someone who celebrates her special day today!",
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_FestivalSciel_Gustave,"Seriously though, this is gonna hurt tomorrow.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_PictosTrader_Gustave,Seriously? I can think of better ways to spend a token.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_FestivalEmma_Emma,She really wants off this island.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalBastien_Bastien,She won’t be there for long.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_Tiffanie_Sophie,"Shh, he might hear us.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_FestivalAlan_Gustave,Shit.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/19_MaelleDuel_Maelle,Shush. You’re lucky you have a sister who cares.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_Tiffanie_Tiffanie,So Gustave really did come huh?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_Richard_Richard,So I sewed a special uniform for him as my last gift.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_MaelleDuel_Gustave,So do you–,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalLune_Lune,So much of the landscape has changed.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_Cyril_Sophie,"So, what will the article be about?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_FestivalSciel_Gustave,Sober’s better than deathly hungover.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_HotelLove_Sophie,Some prefer more… intimate goodbyes.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_RooftopsEnd_Maelle,Sophie is down there.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/17_Estelle_Estelle,"Sophie, as a thank you, I shall chisel your name onto the statue.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/16_Estelle_Sophie,Sophie.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_Tiffanie_Tiffanie,Sophie…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/16_Marie_Marie,Sorry…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_PictosTrader_Tom,"Still gonna cost you a token though. You’re a resourceful man, there are plenty of ways to earn tokens around here.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_Cyril_Sophie,"Sure, let me think of a headline…",
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_PictosTrader_Gustave,"Sure, why not…",
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_FestivalMaxime_Maxime,"THE PAINTRESS. What, what’s a scrawny shit like YOU gonna do to THE PAINTRESS. Eh? “We’re already dead. You’re just catching up.”",
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_MaelleSophie_Sophie,Take care during the expedition. Gustave told me a lot of wonderful things about you.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_FestivalApprentices_Gustave,Take care of each other.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/29_Cyril_Sophie,Take care of yourself.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_ArtefactLady_Colette,Take good care of it. Godspeed.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/27_Cyril_Cyril,Thank you for all these times.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_Richard_Sophie,"Thank you, Richard.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/22_Nicolas_Sophie,Thank you.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/27_Eloise_Eloise,Thank you… Now I think I know…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/22_Richard_Richard,Thanks to both of you. And see you.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/15_Ulysse_Ulysse,Thanks!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_Mime_Sophie,"Thanks, Gustave.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_Ophelie_Gustave,"Thanks, Ophélie.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_RooftopsEnd_Gustave,Thanks.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_FestivalLune_Lune,Thanks.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_Jules_Gustave,Thanks.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_Nicolas_Nicolas,That is of no consequence in the matters of love.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/28_Nicolas_Nicolas,That was slightly disappointing.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/19_Nicolas_Nicolas,That was splendid! Splendid!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_Ulysse_Ulysse,"That's what I think too. The others laugh, but I know they're real.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_Ulysse_Ulysse,That's why I'm training everyday by beating up my little brother!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_Jules_Jules,That's… He made that overnight?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/16_Eloise_Eloise,That's… This guy is strong…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_Ulysse_Sophie,That's… Yeah. You would make a great Gestral.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalMichel_Michel,"That’s just what sore losers say. Come now, you gonna be a little cautious mouse with the Paintress too?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_ArtefactLady_Gustave,That’s kind of you to share.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalCatherine_Catherine,That’s ok.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_Quizmaster_Antoine,That’s tomorrow. What about today?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_FestivalMaxime_Gustave,"That’s why we’re going. We CAN save them. With our Lumina tech, the Paintress–",
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_Mime_Sophie,That… That was close…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalEmma_Gustave,The Chief Councilor honours us with her presence.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_Eloise_Eloise,The Expeditions… What a joke.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalFlorian_Florian,The Paintress is going to punish you! You blasphemers. The Gommage is our fault! We brought this upon ourselves. Because we dared to defy her!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_Mime_Display,The mime reacts. It attacks!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_Cyril_Sophie,The pale sun ascends above the crimson blossoms.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_MaelleDuel_Gustave,"The rest of us only have a year left, but you’ve got nine good years before your Gommage.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalMaxime_Gustave,Then maybe you should be with her.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/18_Eloise_Eloise,"Then, madam, why didn't you join?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalLune_Lune,"Theoretically. I extrapolated from the archives, but… it was 67 years ago.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_FestivalEmma_Emma,There are so many things you can contribute to HERE in Lumière. That’ll have a REAL impact.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_Eloise_Sophie,There are some special people in this one.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_TrashcanMan_Display,There is a message inside.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_Mime_Sophie,There is something on its body.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalSciel_Gustave,These all yours?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/17_Eloise_Sophie,They all train their Pictos skills very hard to save us all. And so did your father.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_HotelLove_Display,They stopped…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalApprentices_Alexandre,They’ll definitely want that for the Museum! The complete record of the Expedition that DESTROYED the Paintress!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalJerome_Jerome,Think there’s other survivors out there?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalEmma_Emma,"This is the definition of a fool’s quest, and my brother’s not usually a fool.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_Nicolas_Nicolas,This lady truly is exquisite.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_Estelle_Estelle,"This may be my life's finest work, yet not a single soul seems to care.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/25_MaelleDuel_Maelle,"This time, I’m not messing around!",
ST_DS_Lumiere/15_Tiffanie_Sophie,Tiffanie…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalSciel_Gustave,To Soph.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalSciel_Sciel,To Sophie. Who was always… unapologetically Sophie. My fierce and loving friend.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/17_Nicolas_Nicolas,Too bad…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_TutorialOutcomes_Maelle,"Too slow, old man!",
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_Mime_Sophie,"Uh, hello?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalVictor_Gustave,Uncle Victor. Suits you.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalRaphael_Gustave,Unofficial expedition motto. You never heard Lucien say it either? It’s one of his favourites.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_Hairstylist_Amandine,Voilà! Looking very fine indeed. You’ll die with a gorgeous head of hair.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_Nicolas_Sophie,We broke up.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_Eloise_Eloise,We could have spent one more year together instead of wasting it away…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_FestivalAlan_Gustave,"We have a really good team, thanks to you. That’s our edge.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_Mime_Sophie,We should leave.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalJerome_Gustave,We were lucky the Fracture dropped us out here. Bought us time to get our defences up.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_Ulysse_Ulysse,We're tired of the orphanage…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_ArtefactLady_Colette,Welcome back. You’re here for the artefact?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/29_Quizmaster_Antoine,"Well done, well done.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_Tiffanie_Tiffanie,"Well, there are less and less people to buy them…",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalTristan_Gustave,Well. It’s Lune.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_Cyril_Cyril,Well…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_FestivalEmma_Emma,"We’re her guardians, not her jailers.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_FestivalEmma_Emma,We’re never going to see each other again.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalMathilde_Gustave,We’re not dying yet.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/30_Nicolas_Nicolas,"What a beautiful couple, thank you again.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalBastien_Gustave,What about you? Heard you were elected “Commander 32.” Congrats.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_FestivalCatherine_Gustave,What about you? You say goodbye to Derrick?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/16_Quizmaster_Gustave,"What are you talking about? Every child knows this. The Monolith’s essentially a reverse calendar, counting down since the Fracture happened in Year 100.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalSeba_Seba,What can I say? I’m an optimist. Or an idiot. Depends on who you ask.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/24_Quizmaster_Antoine,What is a “Lumina?”,
ST_DS_Lumiere/15_Estelle_Estelle,What's your name?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalEmma_Gustave,What. You still mad I’m going?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_MaelleFirstDuel_Gustave,What?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_Jules_Gustave,What?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/26_Eloise_Sophie,"When the time comes, you'll make the right decision. I'm sure.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalMaxime_Maxime,Where do you THINK. Mourning her mother. On the ANNIVERSARY of her death. Of all their deaths.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalAlan_Gustave,Where’s your daughter?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/18_Quizmaster_Antoine,Which was the first expedition to depart for the continent?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_Quizmaster_Gustave,Who am I to deny you. Fire away.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalLucien_Gustave,"Who, exactly, are you talking to? They cut servers from the budget years ago.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalRaphael_Raphael,Why does Manon keep saying “death comes to us all?”,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_Henri_Sophie,Why? Aren't you enjoying the show?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_Nicolas_Nicolas,"Will you help me? If you inspire me, you may become the main painting of Lumière's Opera.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/20_Cyril_Cyril,With the Paintress each year claiming the beauty of this world.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_Jules_Jules,"Wow, so many Expeditioners! So cool!",
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_FestivalTristan_Tristan,"Yeaahh. Let’s just say, they ran a tight ship.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_MaelleFirstDuel_Gustave,Yeah I hum… Yeah.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_FestivalApprentices_Gustave,"Yeah, I have to go talk to her.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_RooftopsEnd_Gustave,"Yeah, I know.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_MaelleDuel_Gustave,"Yeah, I know.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalAlan_Gustave,"Yeah, I– Yeah.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalRaphael_Gustave,"Yeah, I’ve heard that one recently.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_Eloise_Eloise,"Yeah, right…",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalCatherine_Gustave,"Yeah, umm.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_FestivalLucien_Gustave,"Yeah, well, we’ve only tested it here. Who knows what we’ll meet on the main continent. We’ll need more field-testing once we land.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_FestivalCatherine_Gustave,"Yeah, we’re all we have.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalLucie_Gustave,Yeah.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_FestivalAlan_Gustave,Yeah.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/16_MaelleFirstDuel_Gustave,Yeah.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalBastien_Gustave,Yeah– Been ready.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/30_Cyril_Cyril,Yeah…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_Tiffanie_Tiffanie,Yeah… Everybody's heading to the harbour.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_MaelleSophie_Maelle,Yeah… Let's hope we will.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_MaelleFirstDuel_Maelle,Yes!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_ArtefactLady_Gustave,"Yes, I’m curious, here’s a token.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/21_Richard_Sophie,"Yes, he is…",
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_Eloise_Eloise,"Yes, that's what my father told me last year.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_Quizmaster_Antoine,Yes. When did our world break apart and our luminous city get thrown into the middle of the ocean? When was the Fracture?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_FestivalEmma_Emma,"You and I both know the political complexities that necessitate the Expedition. It’s vital for morale, but it’s a bloodless guillotine, is what it is–",
ST_DS_Lumiere/32_Quizmaster_Gustave,You big softie.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalLucie_Gustave,You came.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_FestivalRaphael_Gustave,"You can really find the silver lining in everything, can’t you?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalSciel_Sciel,"You can start now. Here, let’s have a toast.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/28_Quizmaster_Antoine,You created the Lumina Converter. How can you not know this? Go again.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_Cyril_Sophie,You don't know?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_MaelleDuel_Gustave,You don’t need to leave yet. It’s a lot of risk.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalSciel_Sciel,You gonna lecture ME on drinking?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FestivalRaphael_Gustave,You haven’t heard that before?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/05_Eloise_Sophie,"You know their goal is to save us all, right?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_MaelleFirstDuel_Maelle,You look tense.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/16_FestivalEmma_Emma,You mean the one you so kindly wrote for me?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_FestivalLune_Gustave,You need a drink.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_Eloise_Sophie,"You never know, this Expedition might be different.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalCatherine_Catherine,You ok? Wanna talk about it?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/23_Cyril_Cyril,"You really are a divine being, Sophie.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_Cyril_Sophie,You really are lazy.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_FestivalMaxime_Maxime,"You really think you’re doing something, eh? Out there?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_Estelle_Estelle,You seem like a woman with exquisite taste.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalMaxime_Gustave,You should go home. Where’s your daughter?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/06_FestivalEmma_Gustave,You should put that in your speech. Very motivating. They might just find a guillotine for you too.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_Jules_Jules,You take it.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_Quizmaster_Gustave,You want a rematch don’t you?,
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_MaelleFirstDuel_Maelle,"You won! Now, don't you feel better? I see your smile.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/13_PictosTrader_Tom,You won’t regret it. Probably.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_FestivalLucien_Lucien,"You wound me. But yes, in fact, I do have a bottle. “Always be prepared.”",
ST_DS_Lumiere/01_Henri_Henri,You'd have to be crazy to use Pictos on your own body.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/08_Tiffanie_Tiffanie,"You're a lucky one, you know.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_Cyril_Cyril,You're as gorgeous as always!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/12_Estelle_Sophie,You're most welcome.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/02_FlowerReminder_Maelle,You're not going to make a big impression on Sophie if you forget your flower.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_Nicolas_Sophie,Your canvas seems quite empty.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_Eloise_Sophie,Your father fought to offer you a better future…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_Marie_Marie,Your flowers…,
ST_DS_Lumiere/14_PictosTrader_Tom,Your loss!,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_PictosTrader_Gustave,Your personal masterpiece seems a little… unorthodox.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/09_Quizmaster_Gustave,"You’re kidding, this is your question?",
ST_DS_Lumiere/23_MaelleDuel_Maelle,"You’re pretty much the oldest man in Lumière now, non? C’mon.",
ST_DS_Lumiere/10_FestivalEmma_Gustave,"You’re so busy anyway, I barely see you–",
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_FestivalLucien_Gustave,You’re such an idiot.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/03_FestivalLucie_Gustave,You’ve been avoiding us. You didn’t have to.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/11_FestivalCatherine_Gustave,–I really thought you guys would work out.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/07_FestivalMichel_Michel,‘Cause winning is fun.,
ST_DS_Lumiere/04_FestivalMichel_Gustave,“Cautious” is good. Keeps you alive.,

ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/25_AliciaClea_Clea,"Honestly, if Aline wants to numb herself in the Canvas, then let her.",
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/19_AliciaClea_Clea,"I already have. Aline is more skilled than Renoir, but I’ve tipped the scales in his favour.",
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/29_AliciaClea_Clea,"I don’t have time to coddle her. And before Verso died, she would have said the same.",
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/20_AliciaClea_Clea,"I have my pets in place. “She who controls chroma, controls the Canvas.” I can’t take her chroma, but I can keep it from returning to her.",
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/30_AliciaClea_Clea,I need you to take care of yourself while I’m gone.,
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/40_AliciaClea_Clea,"If you really want to be useful, then enter the Canvas and help Renoir. I need him back here sooner rather than later.",
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/41_AliciaClea_Clea,"I’ll fight this war alone if I have to, but I’d really rather not.",
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/44_AliciaClea_Clea,"Lest you forget, the only reason those two are in there is because your naivety cost Verso his life.",
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/01_AliciaClea_Clea,Our parents are quite the stubborn pair. They’re still fighting each other inside the Canvas.,
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/28_AliciaClea_Clea,She’s a grown woman and she was the head of the Painters’ Council. She failed her responsibilities.,
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/36_AliciaClea_Clea,"The Writers used you against us once before, they won’t hesitate to use you again.",
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/33_AliciaClea_Clea,The conflict is spreading and there are things I must do if we Painters are to survive.,
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/06_AliciaClea_Clea,They’ve spent longer than this in other Canvases. It’s not that dire.,
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/38_AliciaClea_Clea,Verso traded his life for yours. I both love and hate him for that. The damn fool.,
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/23_AliciaClea_Clea,"With the exception of her obscene fake family. She’s made them immortal, but luckily, they’re also quite useless.",
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/09_AliciaClea_Clea,"Yes, I know, Maman’s been in there for quite a while already.",
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/22_AliciaClea_Clea,"Yes, it’s enough. It’s just a matter of time. As she weakens, Renoir is able to erase her oldest creations.",
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/35_AliciaClea_Clea,"You will do nothing. You’re too weak to do anything useful, you’d be a liability.",
ST_DS_LumiereMayhem/11_AliciaClea_Clea,"You’re as bad as Aline. He’s not Verso. He’s a painted copy, built from our mother’s memories. You’d do well to remember that.",

ST_DS_RdEsquie/A13_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,And François is just like you!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/39_RdEs5Secrets_Display,And he’s secretly touched that Esquie knows him so well.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/12_RdEs6DFrancois_Francois,And mine disappeared.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/21_RdEs6DFrancois_Francois,And tell Esquie I said– tell him to come back soon.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/27_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,And you like when she gets excited about stuff too.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/07_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,"And! When she smiles at me, I feel warm and fuzzy.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/18_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,"Anyway, look, maybe we can trade him something. What does he like? Flowers? Fruit? Shiny things?",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/09_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,Are we talking about the same François? Monsieur Grumpface?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/15_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,Are you getting warm? Your face looks kind of red.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/06_RdEs3Armbands_Verso,Are you jealous?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/05A_RdEs6CUrrie_Display,"As they leave the cave, the Expeditioners hear François crying dramatically in the distance.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/29_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,Ask me how I know.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/04_RdEs6EFluffySoul_Verso,"Aw, shucks. Go on. Tell me more.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/03_RdEs6CUrrie_Esquie,"Aww, Urrie! I’ve missed you! Thank you, Franfran!",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/00_RdEs6EFluffySoul_Display,"Back at camp, Esquie swallows Urrie, his new rock.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/24_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,Because it’ll be a BETTER rock!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/25_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,"Better, um… How?",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/17_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,But Napping cannot be taught. It can only be experienced.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/03_RdEs7OtherVerso_Esquie,"But it’s ok, she’ll be back for a visit and he’ll be all happy again!",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/20_RdEs6DFrancois_Verso,Bye François.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/31_RdEs1Stones_Verso,Debatable.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/09_RdEs1Stones_Verso,Did François finally move out and get his own cave?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/08_RdEs7OtherVerso_Verso,"Do you miss– Verso? I mean, your Verso. The real Verso.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/12_RdEs7OtherVerso_Verso,Does it– does it bother you? That I’m not him?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/03_RdEs6BFrancoisReunion_Francois,Don’t call me that.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/12_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,"Don’t lie. When she smiles at you, you feel warm and fuzzy too.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/38_RdEs1Stones_Verso,"Don’t worry, I’ll help you get them back.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/01_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,Enjoying the stars?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/14_RdEs7OtherVerso_Verso,"Esquie I… Thank you, mon ami.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/20_RdEs2Cousins_Display,Esquie and Verso have fun talking to each other a bit more.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/43A_RdEs1Stones_Display,Esquie and Verso rekindle the flame of their friendship.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/13_RdEs6EFluffySoul_Display,Esquie and Verso talk a bit more about random things before heading back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/09_RdEs6DFrancois_Verso,Esquie cares about you. You’re his best friend.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/22_RdEs3Armbands_Display,Esquie dances around with his armband for a bit before they return to the others.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/17_RdEs7OtherVerso_Display,Esquie has touched Verso’s heart with his words.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/20_RdEs3Armbands_Display,Esquie is even more excited than usual.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/06_RdEs6DFrancois_Verso,"Esquie says you’re not really grumpy, you’re just sad.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/02_RdEs1Stones_Verso,"Esquie, mon ami.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/04_RdEs6DFrancois_Francois,Esquie’s TOO happy all the time. What’s there to be happy about? Just… leave me alone.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/01_RdEs6CUrrie_Francois,"FINE, FINE, FINE. Here.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/08_RdEs6EFluffySoul_Verso,Fluffiest??,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/11_RdEs4Constellations_Esquie,Franfran used to be all “Wheeeee!” But now he’s all “Whooo.”,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/02_RdEs6BFrancoisReunion_Esquie,Franfran!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/17_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,François can dance?? I’ve never even seen him move. I guess he sort of wiggles his head sometimes…,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/01_RdEs7OtherVerso_Verso,"François really misses Clea, huh.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/30_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,Friends are like rocks. You can never have too many.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/30_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,"Gee, thanks.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/03_RdEs6EFluffySoul_Verso,Glad I could help.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/09_RdEs6BFrancoisReunion_Francois,"HARUMPH. NO DEAL. You want Urrie, COME AND GET IT.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/16_RdEs3Armbands_Verso,Happy now?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/13_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,He hates napping alone.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/07_RdEs6CUrrie_Verso,He really does miss her…,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/29_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,"Hey, that one looks a little like Monoco.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/A11_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,He’d hate that you said that.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/08_RdEs4Constellations_Esquie,"He’s not grumpy, he’s just sad. He misses Clea.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/07_RdEs7OtherVerso_Verso,Hm.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/11_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,Hm. François’ not gonna give you Urrie without a fight.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/18_RdEs6DFrancois_Verso,Hm. Well. I’ll get going then.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/04_RdEs7OtherVerso_Verso,Hm. You really think so?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/12_RdEs2Cousins_Esquie,"Hmmmmm. Yes, yes, yes. Aha! Just like Verso is Verso’s cousin, Maelle is Maelle’s cousin! Ahhhhh, yes! That’s it.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/18_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,How come you’re not grumpy like François?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/11_RdEs6DFrancois_Francois,Hrmph. Shows what you know. His best friend died.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/19_RdEs4Constellations_Esquie,I AM grumpy.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/01_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,I can’t believe you told Sciel about the wine.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/05_RdEs6DFrancois_Francois,"I don’t care what you believe, now GET YOUR EXPEDITIONER BUTT OUTTA MY CAVE.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/14_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,I don’t get warm and fuzzy.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/01_RdEs6DFrancois_Francois,I don’t have any more of your stinking stones!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/27_RdEs1Stones_Verso,I don’t need more friends. I have you.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/03_RdEs1Stones_Verso,I feel like I haven’t seen you in years.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/05_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,"I guess? It’s very, uh, round? Like François.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/14_RdEs3Armbands_Esquie,I have a big brain–,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/32_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,"I hope we won’t lose them, like the others…",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/10_RdEs7OtherVerso_Verso,"I just wondered, because… you never mention him with me.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/08_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,I left Urrie in François’ cave!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/41_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,I lose them so we can go on more adventures!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/03_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,I love the way you see the world.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/19_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,I see.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/19_RdEs3Armbands_Esquie,I shall treasure this. Forever.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/08_RdEs6BFrancoisReunion_Esquie,I think we captured your essence beautifully.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/26_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,I think we’re both a little “WhooWheeWhooWhee WheeWhoo.”,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/11_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,I thought you would understand.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/21_RdEs4Constellations_Esquie,I too am “Whooo.” But I’m also “Wheee!” So the “Wheee” balances the “Whooo.”,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/A07_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,I was afraid the others would want to return to Lumière if you could fly them back.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/15_RdEs6DFrancois_Verso,"If you wanna stay grumpy in your cave though, I get it.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/15_RdEs1Stones_Verso,"If you’re here, then isn’t he napping alone?",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/14_RdEs1Stones_Verso,Impressive. You must teach me your secrets.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/07_RdEs6BFrancoisReunion_Francois,Is that s’posed to be ME?!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/14_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,It made him so happy. And you have such a lovely voice.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/11_RdEs7OtherVerso_Esquie,It makes you sad.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/08_RdEs6DFrancois_Verso,It wouldn’t kill you to be nicer to Esquie.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/06_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,It’s not grumpy enough. It needs to look a bit more cranky.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/10_RdEs6DFrancois_Francois,It’s not my JOB to be NICE to people.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/17_RdEs2Cousins_Esquie,"It’s ok if you don’t understand, Verso. You’re still wise to me.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/25_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,I’m a bit “WheeWhooWheeWhoo” myself.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/30_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,I’m not flustered…,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/13_RdEs6DFrancois_Verso,I’m sorry. But you still have each other.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/21_RdEs1Stones_Verso,I’m sure he’ll survive.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/39_RdEs1Stones_Verso,I’ve brought your stones back ten times now. Are you losing them on purpose?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/06_RdEs7OtherVerso_Esquie,Just like you would never leave me.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/15_RdEs7OtherVerso_Esquie,Let’s keep going on adventures forever!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/28_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,Losing a rock is better than never having a rock!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/21_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,Lune doesn’t strike me as a… rock enthusiast.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/23_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,"Lune knows a lot about lots of things. Talking to her is super fun, she’s so interested and gets so excited. Just like you when we first met. You had so many questions about me and you and your–",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/13_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,Maybe if you serenade him? He and Clea used to sing allll the time.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/10_RdEs3Armbands_Esquie,Maybe.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/42_RdEs1Stones_Verso,Me too.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/04_RdEs2Cousins_Esquie,Mmm hmmm. Have I met her before??,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/A10_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,Mmm. You’re just like François.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/06_RdEs6EFluffySoul_Esquie,Mon ami.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/16_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,Mon ami. I wish I could.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/05_RdEs2Cousins_Esquie,"No, Maelle. Have I met her before?",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/09_RdEs7OtherVerso_Verso,"No, of course you do, sorry, I don’t know why I asked that, that was stupid.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/32_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,No.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/03_RdEs3Armbands_Verso,Not really my style.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/12_RdEs3Armbands_Esquie,"Not true! Anyway, I want a headband–",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/01_RdEs6EFluffySoul_Esquie,"Now that I have Urrie, we can explore UNDERWATER!",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/04_RdEs4Constellations_Esquie,"OOooohh, that constellation looks like François.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/11_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,Of Napping!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/22_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,Of course she does.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/33_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,Of course.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/07_RdEs2Cousins_Esquie,"Oh but I do! Wait, don’t I?",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/10_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,Oh oh oh! I have been perfecting the Art…,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/10_RdEs2Cousins_Esquie,"Oh well that’s because you’re all cousins! Same same, but different.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/05_RdEs6CUrrie_Esquie,"Oh, François…",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/A06_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,"Oh, I didn’t… I…",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/09_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,"Oh, I thought I was more of a wine-keeper than a secret-keeper.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/12_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,"Oh, I’d rather not fight. He was soooo mad last time!",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/16_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,"Oh, oh, and she showed me a really cool rock!",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/16_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,"Oh, oh, oh! Or maybe you can DANCE with him? You’re an EXCELLENT dancer.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/09_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,"Oh, right right.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/06_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,"Oh, you’ve been counting too!",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/30_RdEs4Constellations_Esquie,Ohhh and if you squint and sort of scrunch up your face that one next to it looks like Noco…,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/19_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,Ohhhh. He must miss me so much right now. Poor Franfran!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/A12_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,Ohhhh. OHHH!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/03_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,Ohhhh. Well. She’s very persuasive.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/19_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,Ohhhhhhhhhh. I know! We trade him…,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/20_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,"Oho, are you now?",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/10_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,Okay.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/A15_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,"Ooh, ooh, ooh! Meanies who hide things but who aren’t really meanies! Verso, Verso, I rememberrrrrr!!!!",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/18_RdEs3Armbands_Esquie,Oohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh this is the NICEST thing EVER!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/20_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,"Oooh, but Lune is helping me study it. She knows a lot about rocks!",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/16_RdEs2Cousins_Esquie,"Ooooh great name. Ohohoh, can I be Esquie the Great? Nono, wait, how about Esquie the Brave? Ahh, nono, Esquie the Great is better.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/31_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,Ooooh how about that rock over there!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/05_RdEs6BFrancoisReunion_Francois,PROVE it.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/02_RdEs6CUrrie_Francois,Pah! Take your rock and SCRAM!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/12_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,Pahaha François would miss me too much.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/05_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,Really.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/34_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,Really?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/11_RdEs2Cousins_Verso,"Right. So, maybe it’s that?",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/07_RdEs1Stones_Verso,Roughly.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/04_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,Sciel said sharing is caring.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/01_RdEs2Cousins_Esquie,She reminds me of someone…,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/23_RdEs1Stones_Verso,So how did these Expeditioners convince you to leave your cave?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/08_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,So she smiled at you and you cracked? Some secret-keeper you are.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/06_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,So where is Urrie?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/09_RdEs3Armbands_Verso,So you want an armband too?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/36_RdEs1Stones_Verso,So. You lost your stones again? How did you lose them this time?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/09_RdEs2Cousins_Verso,Sometimes I feel like you know everyone.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/23_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,Sounds like you’re in a “WhooWheeWhooWhee” type situation.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/02_RdEs4Constellations_Esquie,Stars are the apples of the sky.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/20_RdEs1Stones_Verso,"Sure, that sounds nice.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/27_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,Sure. Why not?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/32_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,Ta-da! Doesn’t it look JUST like him? I almost feel like François is here with us.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/05_RdEs1Stones_Verso,Ten hours and seven minutes.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/15_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,Thanks Esq. Not sure François wants to hear me sing though.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/19_RdEs6DFrancois_Francois,Thanks for the rock. It’s nice to have a picture of Clea.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/10_RdEs6EFluffySoul_Verso,Thanks. I guess.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/01_RdEs3Armbands_Esquie,That armband looks nice.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/43_RdEs1Stones_Verso,That’s a good reason. To adventure then.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/A08_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,That’s mean. Sometimes you’re really mean. Mmm. But being mean is not necessarily a mean thing.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/A04_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,That’s not a happy look…,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/28_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,"That’s not what– What exactly are you say— No, forget it, we’re getting off-topic…",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/06_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,That’s what persuaded you??,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/19_RdEs2Cousins_Esquie,That’s why we’re best friends!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/18_RdEs7OtherVerso_Display,The bond between Verso and Esquie is now unbreakable and eternal.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/21_RdEs2Cousins_Display,Their bond grows.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/12_RdEs6EFluffySoul_Display,Their incredible adventure has made the bond between Verso and Esquie even stronger.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/20_RdEs7OtherVerso_Display,Then head back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/33_RdEs4Constellations_Display,Then head back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/16_RdEs6DFrancois_Verso,There’s a whole world just outside. And you have friends who care about you.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/24_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,"They are all so nice! Well, the super nice one died but… the others are cool too.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/05_RdEs7OtherVerso_Esquie,"They are best friends. It’s been a few centuries, but she wouldn’t leave him.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/32_RdEs4Constellations_Display,"They spend more time looking at the stars, saying they look like things they absolutely do not look like.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/22_RdEs2Cousins_Display,They talk a bit more nonsense before going back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/19_RdEs7OtherVerso_Display,They talk more about what kind of adventures they want to go on next.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/40_RdEs5Secrets_Display,"They then enjoy a giant hug that lasts far too long, before returning to the others.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/04_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,"Three years, sixty-seven days and roughly ten hours.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/44_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,To adventuuuuuure!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/28_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,"Uh, do we have the artistic skills for that?",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/05_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,"Uh, which one was Urrie again?",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/21_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,Um…,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/07_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,Urrie helps me swim underwater!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/04_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,Urrie. Right.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/31_RdEs4Constellations_Display,Verso and Esquie feel their bond deepen after this meaningful interaction.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/00_RdEs5Secrets_Display,Verso approaches Esquie with something significant to discuss.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/00_RdEs3Armbands_Display,"Verso approaches Esquie, who stares intensely at his armband.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/21_RdEs3Armbands_Display,Verso has given Esquie the greatest gift ever. Esquie is overcome with emotion.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/38_RdEs5Secrets_Display,Verso is relieved that Esquie has stopped talking about what he thinks of Lune and Sciel.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/01_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,"Verso, Verso, Verso! I remember now! I rememberrrrrrrr!",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/01_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,"Verso, mon ami!",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/02_RdEs6EFluffySoul_Esquie,"Verso, you’re the best.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/31_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,Want a hug?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/18_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,We must nap TOGETHER!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/10_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,"Well, great job there too. There’s barely any wine left.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/06_RdEs2Cousins_Verso,Well. You also thought you knew Sciel.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/26_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,We’ll make it so it looks like François! And we can paint a miniature Clea on top!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/06_RdEs6BFrancoisReunion_Verso,"We’ll trade you. Urrie for this, uh… lovely portrait of you.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/A14_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,What do you mean by that?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/02_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,What happened to not sharing secrets? And “maman’s the word.”,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/08_RdEs1Stones_Verso,What have you been up to?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/13_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,"What, no, that’s not– that’s not true–",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/34_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,"What, you wanna go now?",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/05_RdEs3Armbands_Verso,What’s up with you?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/03_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,Where I lost Urrie!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/37_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,Who would turn down an Esquie hug?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/02_RdEs2Cousins_Verso,Who? Maelle?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/02_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,"Whoah, slow down. Remember what?",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/02_RdEs6DFrancois_Verso,Why are you so mean to Esquie all the time? He’s your friend.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/07_RdEs6DFrancois_Francois,Why do you care? How many times do I have to tell you to GO. AWAY.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/22_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,Why would he want another rock?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/A05_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,Why’d you hide Soarrie from me?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/29_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,"Worst case scenario, it doesn’t work and you fight him for it.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/15_RdEs4Constellations_Esquie,"Yah, centuries go by without your best friends, that’s gonna make you go “Whooo.”",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/35_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,Yay!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/A09_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,"Yeah, uh, exactly.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/26_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,"Yeah, well–",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/17_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,"Yeah. But at least you shared some, uh, “Wheee?”",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/02_RdEs3Armbands_Verso,Yeah. Guess it’s official. We’re part of the “Disaster Expedition” now.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/02_RdEs7OtherVerso_Esquie,Yeah. He waits for her everyday. He stopped singing when she left.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/14_RdEs6DFrancois_Francois,Yeah. I guess.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/37_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,"Yeah… I lost them on our trip back from the Gestral River, right after you left.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/14_RdEs2Cousins_Verso,Yep. Verso the Wise.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/14_RdEs4Constellations_Esquie,"Yes! “Wheeeeee!” Back in the day, when there was nothing in the world except the four of us, flying around on ADVENTURES.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/07_RdEs4Constellations_Esquie,"Yes, and it’s soft and fluffy, just like François! On the inside.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/25_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,"Yes, why? You talk to her all the time. You guys are alllways talking.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/35_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,"Yes, yes, yes! It won’t take long, now that I can FLY. Let’s go see François!",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/22_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,"Yes, yes, yes.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/13_RdEs2Cousins_Esquie,You are so very wise!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/40_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,You are the best! I missed going on adventures with you!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/11_RdEs3Armbands_Verso,You barely have arms.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/17_RdEs3Armbands_Verso,"You better not lose this, like your stones.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/04_RdEs6CUrrie_Francois,You can leave the other one though.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/25_RdEs1Stones_Esquie,You can make some friends too! It’s been a long time since you made new human friends!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/05_RdEs6EFluffySoul_Esquie,You do more than help!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/17_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,You gave her all my best wine for a rock? It better be a special rock. What’s this one called?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/04_RdEs6BFrancoisReunion_Esquie,You have Urrie! Why didn’t you tell me?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/09_RdEs6EFluffySoul_Esquie,You have the fluffiest SOUL.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/26_RdEs1Stones_Verso,You know what I think about friendships with Expeditioners.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/15_RdEs2Cousins_Verso,"You know, that almost makes sense to me.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/03_RdEs2Cousins_Verso,You mean Sciel?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/22_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,You might say you’re a bit “WheeWhooWheeWhoo” then.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/24_RdEs4Constellations_Esquie,"You really get me, Verso.",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/29_RdEs5Secrets_Esquie,You seem flustered.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/13_RdEs3Armbands_Verso,"Your head is humongous, we’re gonna need so much cloth–",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/01_RdEs6BFrancoisReunion_Francois,You’re back.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/18_RdEs2Cousins_Verso,"You’re just a big ball of nonsense sometimes, aren’t ya?",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/13_RdEs7OtherVerso_Esquie,"You’re my friend. Other Verso was also my friend. You are– cousins. Same same, but each different. Why would that bother me?",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/08_RdEs2Cousins_Verso,You’re the one who says all humans seem the same to you.,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/07_RdEs6EFluffySoul_Esquie,You’re the smartest and the fastest and the funniest and the bestest and the strongest and the fluffiest–,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/11_RdEs6EFluffySoul_Esquie,You’re welcome!,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/24_RdEs5Secrets_Verso,You’ve been talking to Lune too?,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/03_RdEs6DFrancois_Verso,"You’ve lied every time you said that, why should I believe you now?",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/04_RdEs3Armbands_Esquie,[blows a tiny raspberry],
ST_DS_RdEsquie/17_RdEs6DFrancois_Francois,[derisive snort],
ST_DS_RdEsquie/06_RdEs6CUrrie_Francois,[dramatic sobs],
ST_DS_RdEsquie/07_RdEs3Armbands_Esquie,[indignant huff],
ST_DS_RdEsquie/16_RdEs7OtherVerso_Esquie,[sound of contentment],
ST_DS_RdEsquie/12_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,“Wheee?”,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/13_RdEs4Constellations_Verso,“Whooo?”,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/28_RdEs4Constellations_Esquie,…,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/A01_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,…,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/A02_RdEs6ARemembers_Verso,…,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/A03_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,…,
ST_DS_RdEsquie/08_RdEs3Armbands_Esquie,"…I’m doing all the hard work, where’s MY armband…",
ST_DS_RdEsquie/20_RdEs6ARemembers_Esquie,…a DIFFERENT rock.,
ST_DS_RdLune/20_RdLu1Trust_Lune,3 questions with 3 follow-ups.,
ST_DS_RdLune/04_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,"46? No, why?",
ST_DS_RdLune/19_RdLu7Song_Verso,A song?,
ST_DS_RdLune/26_RdLu7Song_Lune,"Actually, I was thinking we could work on it together.",
ST_DS_RdLune/06_RdLu2Past_Verso,"After the Fracture… We didn’t have anything. Food, shelter, none of it.",
ST_DS_RdLune/46_RdLu7Song_Display,"After they did what needed doing, they sat for a while and composed music together.",
ST_DS_RdLune/29_RdLu7Song_Verso,"Ah sorry, I promised Monoco I’d help him polish his Nev legs.",
ST_DS_RdLune/26_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,"Ah, a “funny” night owl. Come on, I just shared with you.",
ST_DS_RdLune/01_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,All my life. Everything we did was about the Paintress.,
ST_DS_RdLune/06_RdLu1Trust_Verso,Alliances are usually a give AND take. As are conversations.,
ST_DS_RdLune/08_RdLu1Trust_Lune,Alright then. As a gesture of good faith. I’ll show you how to use Lumina–,
ST_DS_RdLune/15_RdLu1Trust_Verso,"Alright, as a gesture of good faith…",
ST_DS_RdLune/42_RdLu7Song_Lune,"Alright, get your piano, I want your opinion on this section–",
ST_DS_RdLune/32_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,"Alright, we can talk about me again, if you want.",
ST_DS_RdLune/23_RdLu1Trust_Verso,Alright. Go for it.,
ST_DS_RdLune/04_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,Always… Always. Always.,
ST_DS_RdLune/09_RdLu6AExp46_Lune,Am I now?,
ST_DS_RdLune/22_RdLu7Song_Lune,And I’ve decided to be a little selfish with my time. Our problems will still be there in the morning.,
ST_DS_RdLune/16_RdLu1Trust_Verso,"And as a gesture of good faith, I’ll answer three questions.",
ST_DS_RdLune/13_RdLu6BJournals_Verso,And the other way?,
ST_DS_RdLune/19_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,Any other siblings?,
ST_DS_RdLune/02_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,Are you planning to die anytime soon?,
ST_DS_RdLune/A01_RdLu6BJournals_Display,"As they arrive at camp, Verso sees that Lune has a lot on her mind.",
ST_DS_RdLune/34_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,Ask away.,
ST_DS_RdLune/11_RdLu1Trust_Verso,But I appreciate the gesture. Thank you.,
ST_DS_RdLune/36_RdLu7Song_Lune,But it would have been nice…,
ST_DS_RdLune/15_RdLu2Past_Lune,"But this time, you didn’t go back.",
ST_DS_RdLune/23_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,"But– Don’t expect too much, yeah?",
ST_DS_RdLune/31_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,Come on. I just shared with you.,
ST_DS_RdLune/25_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,Come on. It’s not far. Especially now that Esquie can fly.,
ST_DS_RdLune/17_RdLu7Song_Verso,Come on. You’re smiling so it must be good.,
ST_DS_RdLune/49_RdLu7Song_Display,"Despite her disappointment, Lune feels quite close to Verso.",
ST_DS_RdLune/03_RdLu6AExp46_Lune,Did you ever travel with the 46?,
ST_DS_RdLune/04_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,Do you always take such copious notes?,
ST_DS_RdLune/12_RdLu7Song_Lune,Do you even keep a journal?,
ST_DS_RdLune/06_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,Do you like cats?,
ST_DS_RdLune/09_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,Do you like cats?,
ST_DS_RdLune/05_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,Do you like dogs?,
ST_DS_RdLune/08_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,Do you like dogs?,
ST_DS_RdLune/38_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,Do you like monkeys?,
ST_DS_RdLune/24_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,Doesn’t seem fair.,
ST_DS_RdLune/17_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,Doesn’t that feel nice?,
ST_DS_RdLune/09_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,Even her last words were still–,
ST_DS_RdLune/20_RdLu6BJournals_Verso,"Even if they were alive, the voices in your head, the voices you listen to, have to be your own.",
ST_DS_RdLune/06_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,Even when I sleep– It’s still there.,
ST_DS_RdLune/11_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Lune,"Everyone in Lumière starts their apprenticeship at six. And I was apprenticed to my parents, so they started me early…",
ST_DS_RdLune/36_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Lune,Expedition 33: The Band. I like that.,
ST_DS_RdLune/33_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,Fascinating. So you experience discomfort while you sleep? Pain? Are you aware of time passing?,
ST_DS_RdLune/39_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,For science.,
ST_DS_RdLune/11_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,From one insomniac to another…,
ST_DS_RdLune/22_RdLu6BJournals_Verso,Getting there. Sometimes it’s hard to tell.,
ST_DS_RdLune/05_RdLu1Trust_Lune,"Given the circumstances, I think we can skip the pleasantries, no?",
ST_DS_RdLune/34_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,"Great, let’s start a band!",
ST_DS_RdLune/17_RdLu2Past_Verso,Guess I’m hard to trust?,
ST_DS_RdLune/19_RdLu2Past_Verso,Guess they thought I knew more than I did.,
ST_DS_RdLune/28_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Lune,Guitar. You?,
ST_DS_RdLune/20_RdLu2Past_Verso,"Halfway to the Monolith, I was betrayed. Barely escaped.",
ST_DS_RdLune/A02_RdLu6BJournals_Display,"He invites her to talk, away from the others.",
ST_DS_RdLune/36_RdLu2Past_Verso,High praise.,
ST_DS_RdLune/22_RdLu2Past_Lune,Hm.,
ST_DS_RdLune/24_RdLu1Trust_Lune,Hm.,
ST_DS_RdLune/34_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,"Hmm, I should observe you next time you sleep.",
ST_DS_RdLune/03_RdLu2Past_Lune,Hmm.,
ST_DS_RdLune/05_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,Hmm.,
ST_DS_RdLune/35_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,Hmm.,
ST_DS_RdLune/15_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,Hmm. And what’s your current puzzle?,
ST_DS_RdLune/05_RdLu7Song_Verso,"Hmmm. Well, I saw you interview Monoco earlier. So, “A Treatise on Gestral Behaviour”?",
ST_DS_RdLune/33_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,How generous of you.,
ST_DS_RdLune/25_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Lune,Huh.,
ST_DS_RdLune/19_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,I can show you.,
ST_DS_RdLune/02_RdLu2Past_Verso,I did.,
ST_DS_RdLune/15_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,"I didn’t travel with them, but I have come across their, um– their trail.",
ST_DS_RdLune/18_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,I don’t know. Maybe because I still hear their voices in my head? And running away won’t silence them.,
ST_DS_RdLune/35_RdLu2Past_Lune,I enjoyed this conversation.,
ST_DS_RdLune/14_RdLu1Trust_Verso,I feel like we already established that.,
ST_DS_RdLune/23_RdLu7Song_Verso,I fully support taking selfish breaks.,
ST_DS_RdLune/13_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,I guess that’s nice. They got to spend more time with you.,
ST_DS_RdLune/12_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,I just have this feeling you’re a cat person.,
ST_DS_RdLune/11_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,I just have this feeling you’re a dog person.,
ST_DS_RdLune/18_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,I know there’s an important piece of the puzzle there. We need to find and talk to more of them.,
ST_DS_RdLune/14_RdLu2Past_Lune,I see.,
ST_DS_RdLune/06_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,I sleep enough.,
ST_DS_RdLune/04_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,I sleep.,
ST_DS_RdLune/24_RdLu2Past_Lune,I spent my whole life studying the Paintress and the Monolith.,
ST_DS_RdLune/22_RdLu1Trust_Lune,I think it’s reasonable.,
ST_DS_RdLune/10_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,"I think you’ve spent too much time alone, you’ve forgotten how to start a human conversation.",
ST_DS_RdLune/04_RdLu2Past_Verso,"I went back, helped with the rebuild.",
ST_DS_RdLune/17_RdLu6BJournals_Verso,"If you hate it so much, why continue their work at all?",
ST_DS_RdLune/29_RdLu2Past_Lune,"If you must know, what I really miss are viennoiseries.",
ST_DS_RdLune/52_RdLu7Song_Display,"Instead, they spend time composing music.",
ST_DS_RdLune/15_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,Interesting name.,
ST_DS_RdLune/21_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,Is that how it works for you?,
ST_DS_RdLune/11_RdLu6BJournals_Verso,It also shows how much faith she had in you.,
ST_DS_RdLune/31_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,"It is, isn’t it?",
ST_DS_RdLune/02_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,"It was a constant hum in the background. This worry, this responsibility.",
ST_DS_RdLune/07_RdLu7Song_Verso,"It’s about me, isn’t it.",
ST_DS_RdLune/16_RdLu7Song_Lune,"It’s just silly sketches of Esquie, isn’t it?",
ST_DS_RdLune/14_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,It’s like… I pick up a puzzle and I can’t set it down until I solve it.,
ST_DS_RdLune/17_RdLu1Trust_Verso,I’ll answer three questions. Choose wisely.,
ST_DS_RdLune/10_RdLu7Song_Verso,"I’ll trade you, you can read my journal if you let me read yours.",
ST_DS_RdLune/36_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,I’m being sincere. Go ahead. Ask me anything you want. We’ve got all night.,
ST_DS_RdLune/35_RdLu7Song_Lune,I’m glad she’s found some happiness. Or at least some fun.,
ST_DS_RdLune/25_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,I’m shocked it wasn’t you.,
ST_DS_RdLune/17_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,I’m trying to make sense of the things they said.,
ST_DS_RdLune/01_RdLu2Past_Lune,"I’ve been wondering. Why stay on the continent, alone? Why not return to Lumière?",
ST_DS_RdLune/19_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,I’ve talked to a few. They mostly spout nonsense. I wouldn’t expect too much.,
ST_DS_RdLune/03_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,Just. Always there.,
ST_DS_RdLune/04_RdLu7Song_Lune,Keep guessing.,
ST_DS_RdLune/21_RdLu2Past_Verso,Kind of killed my interest in returning home.,
ST_DS_RdLune/30_RdLu7Song_Lune,Let’s go find a comfortable place to compose then.,
ST_DS_RdLune/07_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,Like a breath I can never release.,
ST_DS_RdLune/13_RdLu2Past_Verso,Like my mother.,
ST_DS_RdLune/16_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Lune,"Look at you, getting me to talk about myself.",
ST_DS_RdLune/38_RdLu2Past_Display,"Lune becomes lost in thought, reflecting on the information that Verso has shared.",
ST_DS_RdLune/43_RdLu4Insomnia_Display,Lune can’t restrain herself from asking Verso a few more questions before they head back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdLune/37_RdLu2Past_Display,Lune feels more relaxed in Verso’s presence. She appreciates that Verso has shared actual useful information.,
ST_DS_RdLune/A03_RdLu6BJournals_Display,Lune gazes at Verso as she gathers her thoughts.,
ST_DS_RdLune/26_RdLu6BJournals_Display,"Lune impulsively kisses Verso on the cheek. Caught off-guard, Verso smiles at her, a question in his eyes. Laughing, they return to the others.",
ST_DS_RdLune/00_RdLu1Trust_Display,Lune intercepts Verso as he walks by the fire.,
ST_DS_RdLune/41_RdLu3Siblings_Display,Lune is in such a good mood that she forgets to ask Verso other important questions.,
ST_DS_RdLune/38_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Display,Lune is intrigued by this facet of Verso. And Verso is excited to play music with a fellow music lover.,
ST_DS_RdLune/28_RdLu1Trust_Display,Lune is reluctantly intrigued. As is Verso.,
ST_DS_RdLune/25_RdLu1Trust_Display,Lune spends some time bombarding Verso with questions.,
ST_DS_RdLune/00_RdLu3Siblings_Display,"Lune stands by the fire, deep in thought. Verso tries to get her attention.",
ST_DS_RdLune/10_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,Lune?,
ST_DS_RdLune/40_RdLu7Song_Verso,Lune…,
ST_DS_RdLune/35_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Lune,Maybe we can.,
ST_DS_RdLune/33_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,Maybe we could play together sometime?,
ST_DS_RdLune/20_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,Maybe you weren’t asking the right questions.,
ST_DS_RdLune/39_RdLu7Song_Verso,Me? Never.,
ST_DS_RdLune/23_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Lune,Meaning?,
ST_DS_RdLune/26_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Lune,Mine too.,
ST_DS_RdLune/27_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,"Mm. Well. If you change your mind… We can go anytime. It’s not far, on the outskirts of Sirène’s island.",
ST_DS_RdLune/05_RdLu2Past_Lune,Mmhm.,
ST_DS_RdLune/12_RdLu1Trust_Lune,Mmhm.,
ST_DS_RdLune/12_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,Mmhm.,
ST_DS_RdLune/30_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,Mmhm. Feels even nicer when people reciprocate.,
ST_DS_RdLune/33_RdLu7Song_Lune,"Mmm. I dunno, it’s getting late, aren’t you meeting Sciel?",
ST_DS_RdLune/24_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,Music is my passion.,
ST_DS_RdLune/07_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,Must be serious. You’re usually more eloquent than this.,
ST_DS_RdLune/01_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,My fellow night owl.,
ST_DS_RdLune/14_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,"My only value to them. Not as a daughter, but as a backup plan. For their legacy.",
ST_DS_RdLune/20_RdLu7Song_Lune,"My parents said music was frivolous, but you know what?",
ST_DS_RdLune/20_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,"My parents were both artists. Widely-respected, very prominent artists. So. There was a great deal of pressure to follow in their path.",
ST_DS_RdLune/12_RdLu6AExp46_Lune,"My parents. They, um…",
ST_DS_RdLune/17_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,My sister named him when we were kids.,
ST_DS_RdLune/02_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,Night owl?,
ST_DS_RdLune/09_RdLu1Trust_Verso,No need. I got it.,
ST_DS_RdLune/27_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,"No, I’m glad they got to live.",
ST_DS_RdLune/40_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,"No, that’d be creepy.",
ST_DS_RdLune/26_RdLu6AExp46_Lune,"No. No, we can’t afford detours right now.",
ST_DS_RdLune/03_RdLu7Song_Verso,No? “Theories on Axons” then? Or “Observations of Flora and Fauna”?,
ST_DS_RdLune/02_RdLu7Song_Lune,Nope.,
ST_DS_RdLune/02_RdLu1Trust_Verso,Not a lot of options out here. In case you hadn’t noticed.,
ST_DS_RdLune/09_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Lune,Not anymore. Not when you only live to 32.,
ST_DS_RdLune/22_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,Not the kind they wanted me to be.,
ST_DS_RdLune/08_RdLu2Past_Verso,Nothing like the end of the world to bring out the best and worst in us. I almost miss those times.,
ST_DS_RdLune/08_RdLu7Song_Verso,Now I’m dying to know.,
ST_DS_RdLune/32_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,Of course you do.,
ST_DS_RdLune/31_RdLu7Song_Lune,Of course. That is a two-man job.,
ST_DS_RdLune/32_RdLu7Song_Lune,Oh I know you do. You’ve been taking quite a few “selfish breaks” with Sciel lately.,
ST_DS_RdLune/39_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,Oh come on.,
ST_DS_RdLune/15_RdLu7Song_Lune,Oh really.,
ST_DS_RdLune/25_RdLu7Song_Lune,"Oh you do, do you? Maybe we should take a selfish break together.",
ST_DS_RdLune/06_RdLu7Song_Lune,"Oh, so close.",
ST_DS_RdLune/24_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,"Oh, you know, weight of the world, a tortured soul, things like that.",
ST_DS_RdLune/10_RdLu2Past_Lune,Oh.,
ST_DS_RdLune/18_RdLu6AExp46_Lune,Oh.,
ST_DS_RdLune/05_RdLu6AExp46_Lune,Oh. Nothing– I just– I thought maybe–,
ST_DS_RdLune/38_RdLu7Song_Lune,"Okay, I’ll play you the song, but no laughing, or smart-ass comments.",
ST_DS_RdLune/30_RdLu6AExp46_Display,"On Sirène’s island, not far from Sirène’s Coliseum.",
ST_DS_RdLune/18_RdLu1Trust_Lune,Only three?,
ST_DS_RdLune/30_RdLu2Past_Verso,"Oooh, good answer. I miss those too.",
ST_DS_RdLune/16_RdLu2Past_Verso,People didn’t trust me.,
ST_DS_RdLune/18_RdLu2Past_Lune,Perhaps.,
ST_DS_RdLune/29_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,"Piano mostly, but a little guitar as well.",
ST_DS_RdLune/24_RdLu7Song_Verso,Play me your song.,
ST_DS_RdLune/36_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,Precisely. It’s science.,
ST_DS_RdLune/06_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,"Really, four?",
ST_DS_RdLune/27_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,Really. You don’t strike me as the obsessive worrier.,
ST_DS_RdLune/21_RdLu6AExp46_Lune,Really?,
ST_DS_RdLune/37_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,"Remember, you offered.",
ST_DS_RdLune/41_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,Right.,
ST_DS_RdLune/25_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,"Same, I guess.",
ST_DS_RdLune/54_RdLu7Song_Display,Sciel looked a bit disappointed that they came back so early.,
ST_DS_RdLune/47_RdLu7Song_Display,Sciel smiles at them as they return to camp.,
ST_DS_RdLune/18_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,"See, THAT’s how you ask questions.",
ST_DS_RdLune/48_RdLu7Song_Display,She knows.,
ST_DS_RdLune/05_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Lune,Since I was four.,
ST_DS_RdLune/32_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,"Sleep is not very restful for me. I used to have horrible dreams. But somehow, it was worse when they stopped. Now it’s just this… oppressive void.",
ST_DS_RdLune/38_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,So does this mean I can watch you sleep?,
ST_DS_RdLune/29_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,So you knew Gustave for quite a while then?,
ST_DS_RdLune/29_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,So you’d call yourself an obsessive worrier?,
ST_DS_RdLune/26_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,Sol was a great older brother.,
ST_DS_RdLune/19_RdLu1Trust_Verso,Someone’s a bit greedy.,
ST_DS_RdLune/13_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,Sometimes. I just can’t turn off my mind.,
ST_DS_RdLune/11_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,Sorry. You were saying?,
ST_DS_RdLune/23_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,Sounds like my older sister. She was my father’s favourite.,
ST_DS_RdLune/27_RdLu7Song_Lune,Stay up with me tonight. Help me with my song?,
ST_DS_RdLune/18_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,Stella. She was a gifted artist. And… fiery. She definitely made the most of the time she had.,
ST_DS_RdLune/08_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,Still. Four is young.,
ST_DS_RdLune/28_RdLu7Song_Verso,Sure. I’d love to help you with “your song.”,
ST_DS_RdLune/28_RdLu6AExp46_Lune,Thank you.,
ST_DS_RdLune/10_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,Thanks for your concern.,
ST_DS_RdLune/08_RdLu6BJournals_Verso,That’s a lot of pressure.,
ST_DS_RdLune/11_RdLu7Song_Lune,That’s a mouthful.,
ST_DS_RdLune/04_RdLu1Trust_Verso,That’s a terrible way to ask questions. Do you always interrogate people like this?,
ST_DS_RdLune/28_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,That’s actually how I met Gustave. Sol was dating his sister.,
ST_DS_RdLune/30_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,That’s an awful lot of personal questions.,
ST_DS_RdLune/12_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,That’s one way to look at it.,
ST_DS_RdLune/07_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Lune,That’s what happens when you have obsessive researchers for parents.,
ST_DS_RdLune/40_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Display,The discussion is passionate and lasts for several hours. Neither notices the time passing.,
ST_DS_RdLune/16_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,The talking Nevrons. The ones that seem to have personalities and thoughts and feelings.,
ST_DS_RdLune/05_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,There was no relief. Never.,
ST_DS_RdLune/16_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,"They always said, at the end of the game, there are no points for effort. Only results.",
ST_DS_RdLune/43_RdLu3Siblings_Display,They have a bit more fun together before heading back to camp.,
ST_DS_RdLune/14_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Lune,"They needed a research assistant who never went home. The obvious solution, birth your own.",
ST_DS_RdLune/57_RdLu7Song_Display,"They return to camp, their hearts much lighter.",
ST_DS_RdLune/24_RdLu6BJournals_Display,They share a commiserating smile.,
ST_DS_RdLune/44_RdLu7Song_Display,They spend a few hours together.,
ST_DS_RdLune/56_RdLu7Song_Display,"They spend hours together, composing and playing music.",
ST_DS_RdLune/39_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Display,They spend some time discussing their favourite songs and how they learnt music.,
ST_DS_RdLune/53_RdLu7Song_Display,They then head back to camp.,
ST_DS_RdLune/25_RdLu6BJournals_Display,They understand each other.,
ST_DS_RdLune/13_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,They were Expedition 46?,
ST_DS_RdLune/50_RdLu7Song_Display,They’re able to share with each other.,
ST_DS_RdLune/19_RdLu6BJournals_Verso,They’re dead. The voices aren’t theirs. They’re yours.,
ST_DS_RdLune/07_RdLu2Past_Lune,Things must have been chaotic then.,
ST_DS_RdLune/25_RdLu2Past_Lune,This is where I need to be.,
ST_DS_RdLune/12_RdLu2Past_Verso,Those early expeditions. They were search and rescue. We didn’t know about the Paintress then. We just wanted to find our loved ones.,
ST_DS_RdLune/51_RdLu7Song_Display,"Tonight, she doesn’t ask him any more questions.",
ST_DS_RdLune/24_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,Touché.,
ST_DS_RdLune/07_RdLu1Trust_Verso,"Trust goes both ways, no?",
ST_DS_RdLune/13_RdLu1Trust_Lune,Trust works both ways.,
ST_DS_RdLune/40_RdLu3Siblings_Display,Verso and Lune enjoy a moment together.,
ST_DS_RdLune/37_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Display,Verso and Lune have found a common passion.,
ST_DS_RdLune/43_RdLu7Song_Display,"Verso and Lune walk into the woods together, away from camp.",
ST_DS_RdLune/55_RdLu7Song_Display,Verso and Lune’s bond is incredibly strong.,
ST_DS_RdLune/00_RdLu7Song_Display,Verso approaches Lune as she writes in her notebook.,
ST_DS_RdLune/00_RdLu6AExp46_Display,"Verso approaches Lune, sensing she has something on her mind.",
ST_DS_RdLune/00_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Display,"Verso approaches Lune, who is working on the Expedition 33 journal.",
ST_DS_RdLune/00_RdLu2Past_Display,Verso approaches Lune. He can see that she wants to ask him more questions.,
ST_DS_RdLune/39_RdLu2Past_Display,Verso feels ignored and goes back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdLune/42_RdLu4Insomnia_Display,Verso flashes a grin at Lune. Lune can’t help but smile back. The world feels a little brighter when they’re together.,
ST_DS_RdLune/29_RdLu6AExp46_Display,"Verso promised to show Lune where he found Expedition 46, Lune’s parents’ expedition.",
ST_DS_RdLune/26_RdLu1Trust_Display,Verso remains evasive.,
ST_DS_RdLune/35_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,Well that’s not creepy.,
ST_DS_RdLune/21_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,"Well, I’m certainly not as experienced as you.",
ST_DS_RdLune/10_RdLu1Trust_Lune,"Well, aren’t you a quick study.",
ST_DS_RdLune/37_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,"Well, it’s not like we have private rooms here. So, sure… knock yourself out.",
ST_DS_RdLune/13_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,"Well, you’re right. I had a dog named Patte.",
ST_DS_RdLune/14_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,"Well, you’re wrong. I did have a dog named Patte, though.",
ST_DS_RdLune/13_RdLu7Song_Verso,Well.,
ST_DS_RdLune/18_RdLu7Song_Lune,Well. If you must know. I’m working on a song.,
ST_DS_RdLune/03A_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Lune,"Well. You never know what tomorrow brings. Not to you, but to us.",
ST_DS_RdLune/20_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,Were you close?,
ST_DS_RdLune/26_RdLu2Past_Verso,What a long-winded way to avoid answering the question.,
ST_DS_RdLune/03_RdLu1Trust_Lune,What about the previous expeditioners? Did you help them too? Yet they still failed?,
ST_DS_RdLune/23_RdLu2Past_Verso,What about you? Do you miss home?,
ST_DS_RdLune/23_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,What about you? My “fellow night owl?” Why can’t you sleep?,
ST_DS_RdLune/27_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,What do you play?,
ST_DS_RdLune/09_RdLu4Insomnia_Lune,What doesn’t keep me up?,
ST_DS_RdLune/06_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,What is it?,
ST_DS_RdLune/07_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,What keeps you up?,
ST_DS_RdLune/07_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,What?,
ST_DS_RdLune/34_RdLu2Past_Verso,What?,
ST_DS_RdLune/01_RdLu7Song_Verso,What’re you writing this time? More notes on Nevrons?,
ST_DS_RdLune/29_RdLu1Trust_Display,"When the interrogation is over, they go back to the others.",
ST_DS_RdLune/22_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,"When we were younger, I guess. But my brother and sister had their own lives. They didn’t care about my parents’ research.",
ST_DS_RdLune/22_RdLu6AExp46_Lune,When? Before or after you betrayed us?,
ST_DS_RdLune/45_RdLu7Song_Display,Which Lune really needed to release some frustration.,
ST_DS_RdLune/42_RdLu3Siblings_Display,Which Verso takes note of.,
ST_DS_RdLune/27_RdLu1Trust_Display,"Which pisses Lune off, but also triggers her insatiable sense of curiosity.",
ST_DS_RdLune/01_RdLu1Trust_Lune,Why are you allying yourself with us?,
ST_DS_RdLune/11_RdLu2Past_Lune,"Why’d you leave, then?",
ST_DS_RdLune/01_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,Working on the 33’s journal?,
ST_DS_RdLune/12_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,Working with your parents. Sounds fun.,
ST_DS_RdLune/21_RdLu3Siblings_Lune,"Yeah, I had a brother too, Sol. He was the oldest and everyone’s favourite.",
ST_DS_RdLune/02_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,"Yeah, some.",
ST_DS_RdLune/23_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,Yeah.,
ST_DS_RdLune/17_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,Yeah. On Sirène’s island.,
ST_DS_RdLune/14_RdLu7Song_Verso,"Yep, all my deepest darkest secrets. Interested?",
ST_DS_RdLune/27_RdLu2Past_Lune,"Yes, there are things I miss.",
ST_DS_RdLune/28_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,"You did, didn’t you? Feels nice, sharing, huh?",
ST_DS_RdLune/16_RdLu6AExp46_Lune,You have?,
ST_DS_RdLune/30_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Verso,"You know how to summon an instrument from Pictos, right?",
ST_DS_RdLune/09_RdLu2Past_Verso,You know the Dome Shield? My father and I helped build that.,
ST_DS_RdLune/16_RdLu3Siblings_Verso,You named your dog “Paw”? That’s like if my parents named me “Foot.”,
ST_DS_RdLune/03_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,You never seem to sleep.,
ST_DS_RdLune/28_RdLu2Past_Verso,You paint such a vibrant picture.,
ST_DS_RdLune/15_RdLu6BJournals_Verso,You really believe that?,
ST_DS_RdLune/01_RdLu6AExp46_Lune,You said you travelled with other Expeditions?,
ST_DS_RdLune/20_RdLu6AExp46_Verso,You should have said something sooner.,
ST_DS_RdLune/21_RdLu5FamilyBusiness_Lune,You’re an artist then?,
ST_DS_RdLune/08_RdLu4Insomnia_Verso,You’re gonna burn out this way.,
ST_DS_RdLune/21_RdLu1Trust_Verso,You’re really pushing this.,
ST_DS_RdLune/10_RdLu6BJournals_Lune,“Finish our work.”,
ST_DS_RdLune/09_RdLu7Song_Verso,“The Strange and Shattered Life of Verso Dessendre.”,

ST_DS_RdMaelle/A03_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Display,"After a while, Maelle decides to go and talk to him.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/09_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,"Although, I doubt Clea’s been home much. Knowing her, she’s probably hunting down the Writers responsible for the…",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/04_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,Although… technically everyone in Lumière is an orphan.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/33_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Display,And Maelle empathises deeply with Verso.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/48B_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,And Maelle knows it.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/32_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle,"And don’t worry, I’ll make sure the room is packed. I’ll put up posters everywhere in town.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/15_RdMa2Poems_Verso,And knowing… you’ll never stop.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/13_RdMa6ALetter_Maelle,And let’s not talk about what YOU owe her. Don’t you wanna see her too?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/31_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,"And once you left Lumière, I stayed close. I cleared all the really dangerous Nevrons out of your path and I pulled you away on the beach–",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/44_RdMa3Lumiere_Display,As does Verso with Maelle.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/02_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,"Aside from being a sad and lonely orphan, it was great.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/A01_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Display,"At camp, Verso refuses to talk to anyone.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/30_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Verso,At least she’s free now.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/31_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,"Aw, come on, I bet you secretly want people to read and appreciate your poetry.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/14_RdMa5Grief_Verso,"Bad joke, sorry.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/38_RdMa2Poems_Verso,Be kind though.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/37_RdMa4Dreams_Display,Before heading back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/23_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,But I guess Gustave and Emma used to be weird kids too. So they liked me.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/12_RdMa5Grief_Verso,But I guess death heals all wounds too.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/43C_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,But confessing the truth might destroy the trust he has built with Maelle.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/37_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,"But that home is gone. Not just the place, but also the people…",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/31_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,But that turned out to be kinda nice. I got to go everywhere in the city. I probably know the place better than anyone.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/33_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,But you also let Renoir kill the rest of the Expedition. You didn’t help them.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/11_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Verso,But you didn’t even give me the chance to try. You just erased her.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/27_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Maelle,But you’re right. I should have thought of you. I should have given you a chance to say goodbye.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/08_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,"But, I think, even though your birth was unexpected, it was still celebrated.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/27_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,Can I see?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/65_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,Catchy.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/08_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,Clea won’t be happy either. They’re probably driving each other crazy right now.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/19_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,Clea.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/09_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,Clearly I’m Lumière.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/66_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,"Come on, let’s do it!",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/15_RdMa5Grief_Verso,Death is not necessarily final.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/31_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Display,"Despite his frustration, Verso understands Maelle’s words.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/43_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,Did you let Renoir kill Gustave? Could you have saved him?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/28_RdMa2Poems_Verso,Do I get to read yours?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/34_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,Do you miss Lumière?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/11_RdMa5Grief_Maelle,Does it?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/30_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,"Ehhh, mine’s kind of personal.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/03_RdMa2Poems_Verso,Esquie would be horrified that we’re throwing stones into the lake.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/21_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,Even Gustave’s?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/26_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,"Every time I play, it feels like my heart’s about to break from the beauty of the notes.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/06_RdMa5Grief_Maelle,Everytime I think I’ve managed to contain it…,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/06_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,Exactly!,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/68_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,Forged in truth.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/03_RdMa6ALetter_Maelle,From Alicia.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/27_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,From afar. I’d slip back to Lumière occasionally.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/18_RdMa6ALetter_Maelle,"Great, where is she?",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/17_RdMa5Grief_Verso,"Gustave lives on in other ways, right?",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/32_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Display,He appreciates that Maelle is honest with him.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/43B_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,He could have saved Gustave on the cliff.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/A02_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Display,He stands alone by the lake.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/11_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle,Hm. “Chief.” Guess they had bigger dreams for me than I ever did.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/10_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,"Hmm, yeah I guess so.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/09_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,"Hmm, yeah. Your arrival must have caused quite a bit of concern.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/64_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,"How about “Papa, YOU go home.”",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/09_RdMa5Grief_Maelle,How do you do it? After all these years?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/05_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,"How old were you, when your parents passed away?",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/25_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,I can just… lose myself and feel the music through my fingers.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/30_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,I couldn’t exactly take you with me. But I tried to look out for you.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/57_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,I couldn’t take any chances.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/54_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,I did.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/07_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Verso,I didn’t get to say goodbye.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/13_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle,I didn’t.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/16_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Maelle,"I do care. I know you’re hurting, but the person who made that decision wasn’t me. It was her.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/17_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle,I don’t know… still figuring that out. What about you though? What do you want?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/21_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Maelle,I don’t understand. You were ready when you set Papa free.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/01_RdMa6ALetter_Maelle,I found the letter.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/22_RdMa6ALetter_Maelle,I guess we’re climbing.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/05_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,I guess.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/05_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Maelle,I honoured her wishes. That’s something neither you nor Renoir ever did. And not Maman either.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/23_RdMa5Grief_Verso,I imagine what they would say. How they would react to things.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/08_RdMa5Grief_Verso,I know…,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/23_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,I loved it. I really miss performing at the concert hall.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/28_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,I miss that a lot.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/36_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,I need to ask you something…,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/05_RdMa6ALetter_Maelle,I need to see her. I want to talk to her. And understand…,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/56_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,I should have told you everything sooner. But…,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/24_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,"I think she felt you were safer here, away from her war.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/39_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,I think we’re well past that.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/18_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,I used to have lots of nightmares and talk to myself. Kept running away from home all the time.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/31_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle,I want my first concert to be yours.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/17_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,I was a bit more severe than that.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/52_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,I was afraid if you found out about the Canvas and he was there… you would refuse to help me send Maman home.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/07_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,I was an… unwelcome surprise.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/06_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,I wonder what Maman’s doing now. She must be so upset.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/06_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,"I, uh… Around three, I guess? Yeah…",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/19_RdMa6ALetter_Verso,"If I had to guess… There is a place she loves, at the top of the mountain near the Monolith.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/01_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,"In Lumière, did your parents choose your name?",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/17_RdMa6ALetter_Maelle,Is that a yes?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/20_RdMa2Poems_Verso,Is that what you’re writing in your notebook all the time? Depressing poetry?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/02_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,It feels empty now.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/03_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,It feels less oppressive.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/24_RdMa5Grief_Verso,It helps me keep them alive in my mind.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/30_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,It would be my pleasure.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/17_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Maelle,It would have been wrong to deny her just so you could try and talk her out of her decision.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/23_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Verso,It’s different. It’s different.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/21_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,It’s not all depressing.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/03_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Maelle,It’s what she wanted. I owed her that much. We owed her that much.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/25_RdMa5Grief_Maelle,I’ll try that…,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/11_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,"I’m launching them on their journey, and watching them from afar.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/22_RdMa5Grief_Verso,I’m serious. It helps. Or at least… it helps me.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/01_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Maelle,I’m sorry.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/50_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,I’m sorry.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/46_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,I’m sorry. I would have saved him if I could.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/28_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Maelle,"I’m truly sorry, Verso.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/14_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,I’ve met her three times.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/10_RdMa6ALetter_Verso,Just leave her be. Please.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/22_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,Kind of? It’s why he and his sister took me in. Nobody else wanted me.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/13_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,Knowing… they’ll never come back.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/35_RdMa4Dreams_Display,"Laughing, Verso agrees.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/48E_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,Lost in a lie.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/36_RdMa4Dreams_Display,Maelle and Verso discuss the first song Verso should play…,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/34_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Display,Maelle and Verso feel closer to each other.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/40_RdMa2Poems_Display,Maelle and Verso feel closer to each other.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/45_RdMa3Lumiere_Display,Maelle and Verso spend some time reminiscing about the past.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/41_RdMa2Poems_Display,Maelle and Verso spend some time together.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/67_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,Maelle and Verso’s bond is now unbreakable.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/48D_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,Maelle and Verso’s relationship will not progress any further.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/29_RdMa5Grief_Display,Maelle appreciates the silence they share.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/A01_RdMa6ALetter_Display,Maelle asks Verso if they could talk by the lake.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/48F_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,Maelle heads back to the others immediately.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/26_RdMa5Grief_Display,Maelle is sceptical about Verso’s advice.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/34_RdMa4Dreams_Display,Maelle makes Verso pinky swear.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/42_RdMa2Poems_Display,Maelle proves to be extremely critical of Verso’s writing.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/43_RdMa3Lumiere_Display,Maelle starts to open up to Verso. She feels more comfortable with him.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/20_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Verso,Maelle. I wasn’t ready.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/42_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,Maybe ask Sciel.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/29_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle,"Maybe when this is over, we can fix up the opera house and you can perform for us.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/02_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,Mhm. You should try.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/36_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,Mmmmmmmmmm.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/24_RdMa2Poems_Verso,Mostly poetic insults to use on Monoco. I’m currently comparing him to the backside of an owl.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/20_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,Music.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/19_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,"Nah, if that’s weird then we’re all weird. Actually, I kind of think everyone’s a weird kid in someone’s eyes.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/33_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,"No pressure, huh? Alright, guess I’d better start practising.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/44_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,"No, I got there too late. (Lie)",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/15_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle,No. All I wanted back then was to leave Lumière. And see some of the world before I gommaged.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/30_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,Nobody wanted me for any of the fancy apprenticeships. So I got stuck as a runner for the warehouses.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/36_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,"Not just the place, but… everything about that time. The festivals, the gardens, dancing the night away on the harbour… Before– all this.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/04_RdMa5Grief_Maelle,"Nothing, just… thinking about Gustave. And Lucien… and… everyone.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/04_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,OR… he’d be super happy because we’re sending them soaring on fun little adventures!,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/15_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,Oh yeah?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/21_RdMa6ALetter_Maelle,Oh. That Axon…,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/06_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle,Oh. What made you think of that?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/37_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,"Ok, deal!",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/35_RdMa2Poems_Verso,"Okay fine, I’ll let you read mine IF I get to read yours.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/48_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,Okay.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/40_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,On the cliff… Gustave…,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/11_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,Panic’s probably a better word.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/14_RdMa2Poems_Verso,Poetic. But kind of depressing for a 16-year old.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/28_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,"Sciel was a farmer, Lune was a researcher, Gustave was an engineer. What about you?",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/24_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,See. Everyone’s weird.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/70_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,Sending a message to her father.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/20_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,"She found me years later and tried to recruit me. Then she found me again, 16 years ago…",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/24_RdMa6ALetter_Display,"She is most likely in a giant tower on the island of the last Axon, near the Monolith.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/09_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Maelle,She knew what she wanted. You wouldn’t have been able to sway her.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/17_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,"She told you everything, then?",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/27_RdMa5Grief_Display,"She’s not in the mood to talk, but also does not wish to be alone.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/10_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Verso,She’s not you. You don’t know that. I know her better than you do.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/18_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Verso,She’s the last of my family. I have no one left now.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/09_RdMa6ALetter_Maelle,She’s the one who kept coming to me. I think she wants to see me.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/14_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,So was I.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/29_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,"So you knew where I was, and you left me there too.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/53_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,So you let him die.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/05_RdMa2Poems_Verso,"So, they’re like little rock expeditioners?",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/41_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,So. You want to dance the night away?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/11_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,Sounds like Clea.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/12_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,Stone after stone after stone.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/59_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,Thanks. For telling me the truth.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/19_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,That doesn’t surprise me.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/10_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,That must have sucked. For both you and them.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/27_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle,That’s lovely.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/33_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,The Hanging Gardens. Me and Gustave used to go up there a lot.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/01_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,The Monolith looks strange without Maman or her number there.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/16_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,"The first time was right after the Fracture, with Expedition Zero. She stopped us at the Barrier.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/05_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,The meaning behind your name.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/48C_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,The trust Maelle had in Verso is broken.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/46_RdMa3Lumiere_Display,Then head back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/15_RdMa6ALetter_Maelle,Then she can throw us out and we’ll leave her alone.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/13_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,"Then they died. And I bounced around from family to family. I can’t even remember all of them. I was… kind of a weird kid, I guess.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/34_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,There were too many of them to save.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/43_RdMa2Poems_Display,They go back to the others after Maelle is done teasing Verso.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/36_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Display,They head back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/69_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,"They head to the Monolith, and Maelle repaints it.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/08_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,They never wanted kids. And they definitely didn’t want one right before their Gommage.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/71_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,"They return to camp, to the rest of the Expedition.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/10_RdMa5Grief_Verso,They say time heals all wounds…,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/35_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Display,"They sit in silence a little longer. This time, Maelle comforts Verso.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/30_RdMa5Grief_Display,They then head back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/A02_RdMa6ALetter_Display,They walk there together.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/18_RdMa5Grief_Verso,"Through your memories, through his influence on your life, and everyone else’s. Through the Lumina Converter and his research.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/01_RdMa2Poems_Verso,Throwing rocks again?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/22_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,Told me to keep an eye on you.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/20_RdMa5Grief_Verso,Try talking to him.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/06_RdMa6ALetter_Verso,Understand what?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/A01_RdMa3Lumiere_Display,"Verso approaches Maelle, who is alone by the lake.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/A01_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,"Verso approaches Maelle, who’s staring at the Monolith by herself.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/00_RdMa2Poems_Display,"Verso joins Maelle, who is throwing rocks by the lake.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/48A_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,Verso lied to Maelle.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/43D_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,Verso must choose between lying and telling the truth.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/43A_RdMa7Betrayal_Display,Verso must make a choice.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/A01_RdMa5Grief_Display,Verso notices Maelle looking sad and approaches her carefully.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/23_RdMa6ALetter_Display,Verso promised to take Maelle to his sister.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/28_RdMa5Grief_Display,Verso understands. He sits with her in silence.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/11_RdMa6ALetter_Maelle,"Verso. You’re not doing her any favours. You already destroyed her world. Maybe I can help her. She doesn’t owe me, but… maybe I owe her.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/12_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Maelle,Verso…,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/26_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,"Wait, so you’ve been watching me this whole time?",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/29_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,Wandering around the buildings.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/20_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,"Well, I was a weird kid in everyone’s eyes.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/16_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,"Well, reality’s depressing.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/32_RdMa2Poems_Verso,"Well, so is mine.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/13_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,"Well, we all did.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/19_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle,"Well, what did you used to want?",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/16_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,"Well, you’ve certainly done that. What do you dream of now?",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/04_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle,What are you talking about?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/27_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,What did you do in Lumière?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/18_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,What do I want… I guess I’m still figuring that out too.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/16_RdMa5Grief_Maelle,What does that mean?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/42_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,What is it?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/10_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,What kind of life they dreamed for you.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/01_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,"What was it like for you, growing up in Lumière?",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/08_RdMa6ALetter_Verso,"What, kept her scars? No. Don’t go messing with her head, she doesn’t need that, and she doesn’t owe you any answers.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/02_RdMa6ALetter_Verso,What?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/37_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,What?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/26_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,What’s something you liked about Lumière?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/03_RdMa5Grief_Verso,What’s wrong?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/24_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,When the lights dim and the room is hushed and the first notes echo through the chamber.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/29_RdMa2Poems_Verso,"Whoah, kind of a personal request there.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/07_RdMa6ALetter_Maelle,Why Maman…,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/24_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Verso,Why did she do that?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/23_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,"Why, what do you write about? You don’t seem like a sunshine and rainbows type.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/51_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,Why?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/12_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,Why? What did you dream of?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/20_RdMa6ALetter_Verso,With the third Axon.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/08_RdMa2Poems_Verso,Would that make you Lumière then?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/07_RdMa2Poems_Verso,Would that make you the Paintress then?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/32_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,Yah? What was your favourite place?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/39_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,"Yeah, I can’t promise that.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/35_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,"Yeah, I do.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/18_RdMa2Poems_Verso,"Yeah, I enjoy depressing poetry too.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/02_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle,"Yeah, I guess. Why?",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/16_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,"Yeah, I was obsessed with my piano and my paint set.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/33_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,"Yeah, but I bet you secretly want people to read it.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/12_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,"Yeah, it did.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/62_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,"Yeah, it looks bland without a number.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/14_RdMa6ALetter_Verso,"Yeah, of course. She doesn’t want to see me though. Not after everything.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/19_RdMa5Grief_Maelle,"Yeah, that’s true, but… that’s not very comforting when I’m missing him.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/07_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,Yeah.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/39_RdMa3Lumiere_Verso,Yeah. And you’ve got me.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/22_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,"Yeah. Before the Fracture, I studied piano at the Conservatory.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/04_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,Yeah. I kind of miss seeing her there.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/18_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,Yeah. Then tried to kill us when we wouldn’t go home.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/21_RdMa4Dreams_Maelle,Yeah?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/02_RdMa5Grief_Maelle,Yeah…,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/12_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,Yeah… I barely saw her when I was home. She took Verso’s death very personally.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/45_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,Yes. (Truth),
ST_DS_RdMaelle/15_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Verso,"You Painters. You just do what you want, you don’t care how it affects the rest of us.",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/08_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Verso,You didn’t wait. You didn’t give me a chance to persuade her.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/22_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Maelle,You expected that he would erase the Canvas and everyone in it. Isn’t that the same thing?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/17_RdMa2Poems_Maelle,You get it.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/19_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Maelle,You have me. You have us.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/38_RdMa3Lumiere_Maelle,You have us now.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/15_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,You have?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/25_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Maelle,You know why.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/14_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,You must have wanted something for the future.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/01_RdMa5Grief_Verso,You ok?,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/07_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,You said you were an unwelcome surprise.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/38_RdMa7Betrayal_Maelle,"You wouldn’t lie to me, right?",
ST_DS_RdMaelle/09_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,Your name shows how your parents felt about you.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/63_RdMa7Betrayal_Verso,You’re a Paintress. Paint something.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/13_RdMa6BGoodbyes_Verso,You’ve lost two brothers. You know what it’s like to lose your sibling and never get the chance to say goodbye.,
ST_DS_RdMaelle/03_RdMa4Dreams_Verso,"“Maelle” means “chief” and “prince.” Or, I guess “princess.”",

ST_DS_RdMonoco/33_RdMo2Legs_Verso,"Alright then, c’mon, move over and hand me an extra cloth. Let’s get these legs shining so bright they blind our enemies and send them screaming!",

ST_DS_RdMonoco/14_RdMo6AResurrection_Verso,Always.,

ST_DS_RdMonoco/15_RdMo2Legs_Monoco,"And THEN. I transform into one of THEM! HA! Intimidation, AND. CONFUSION!",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/32_RdMo5Thoughts_Display,And Verso knows Monoco would do the same for him.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/36_RdMo2Legs_Display,And bullies Verso into singing along. They sing together with great gusto.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/20_RdMo5Thoughts_Monoco,And have you accepted it?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/17_RdMo1Bragathon_Monoco,And this one time we tried to swim to the red tree island and you got eaten by that snake?,

ST_DS_RdMonoco/08_RdMo6AResurrection_Verso,As you wish. I’ll wake the others.,

ST_DS_RdMonoco/21_RdMo4Bored_Verso,"Come on, let’s go get a drink, I’m parched.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/07_RdMo1Bragathon_Monoco,Coward.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/10_RdMo4Bored_Monoco,"C’mon, let’s duel! It’ll be fun!",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/20_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Verso,Do I have to participate?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/12_RdMo3Haircut_Verso,"Don’t be silly, we’d look ridiculous with matching haircuts.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/30_RdMo2Legs_Monoco,"Errr. Yes, well that would definitely be quite… exhilarating.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/02_RdMo5Thoughts_Verso,Everything okay?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/03_RdMo6DMentor_Monoco,"Everytime he returns, he is slightly changed. I mourn the loss of who he was before.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/08_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Monoco,Fair point.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/26_RdMo2Legs_Monoco,Fair point. I’ll handle the intimidation. You handle the cleanup.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/11_RdMo3Haircut_Verso,Fine!,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/06_RdMo4Bored_Monoco,"Fine, how about a duel? We haven’t had a proper duel in ages! Yes, a duel will be even more fun. Get our blood flowing!",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/22_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Verso,For Noco then.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/12_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Monoco,For Verso. And for you.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/16_RdMo2Legs_Monoco,"From that alone, the battle is already won. The rest… is mere clean up.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/17_RdMo2Legs_Verso,"Funny, doesn’t seem to work for you against Stalacts, does it?",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/05_RdMo6CReunion_Golgra,"Go ahead, bring him back.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/11_RdMo6AResurrection_Verso,Golgra won’t be happy that you’re jumping the queue again.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/17_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Monoco,Golgra!,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/12_RdMo6CReunion_Noco,Golgra?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/14_RdMo6CReunion_Monoco,Golgra?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/24_RdMo1Bragathon_Verso,Good times indeed.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/25_RdMo5Thoughts_Verso,Good times never last.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/23_RdMo1Bragathon_Monoco,Good times. Oh and remember when…,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/11_RdMo1Bragathon_Monoco,"Good, at least you have become wiser.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/16_RdMo3Haircut_Verso,"Great, we’re twins.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/11_RdMo4Bored_Monoco,"Ha, once again, I am VICTORIOUS!",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/08_RdMo1Bragathon_Verso,Have you seen how weak you are now? I’d beat you blindfolded.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/01_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Verso,Haven’t been here in a while.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/06_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Monoco,"He took care of me, now I take care of him. Except I can’t.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/10_RdMo6CReunion_Verso,Hey Noco. How’s my favourite merchant?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/30_RdMo6CReunion_Verso,"He’ll be fine. Better than with you, that’s for sure",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/13_RdMo3Haircut_Monoco,"Hmm, actually, that does look nice. OKAY. I’M IN! STYLE AWAY!",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/13_RdMo1Bragathon_Monoco,Hmpf…,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/06_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Monoco,How did you even know I was here?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/03_RdMo5Thoughts_Monoco,"How does it feel, reaching one’s goal after so many years?",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/05_RdMo2Legs_Monoco,Hrmph. Your lack of enthusiasm is disappointing.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/19_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Golgra,"Humpf, I was hoping you’d say that.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/06_RdMo5Thoughts_Verso,I am sorry my friend.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/04_RdMo3Haircut_Monoco,I beg your pardon! Have you looked in a mirror lately?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/33_RdMo6CReunion_Verso,I could take Golgra by myself.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/18_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Monoco,I demand a trial by combat.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/08_RdMo3Haircut_Monoco,I don’t recall asking for your uninformed opinion.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/16_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Monoco,I have already thought about it thrice.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/10_RdMo5Thoughts_Monoco,"I know I shouldn’t grow attached to humans. They are ephemeral creatures. They come and go and when they go, they never come back.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/08_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Monoco,I know why you’re doing this. And I know how it might end. I’m not gambling on tomorrow.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/27_RdMo6CReunion_Verso,I know you want to keep Noco by your side. But it’s safer there. You’ll see Noco when we get back to the Village.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/01_RdMo1Bragathon_Monoco,I see you’ve got stronger.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/06_RdMo6AResurrection_Verso,"I thought you wanted to wait, until things calmed down?",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/34_RdMo6CReunion_Monoco,I will never show you weakness ever again.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/06_RdMo6CReunion_Monoco,I won’t say thank you.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/10_RdMo2Legs_Monoco,Imagine you’re a Nevron. And you see ME.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/10_RdMo1Bragathon_Monoco,"In the mountains, I have learnt inner peace. These petty provocations do not work on me anymore.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/04_RdMo6AResurrection_Verso,Is it.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/24_RdMo5Thoughts_Monoco,It felt like nothing bad could happen to any of us.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/01_RdMo6AResurrection_Monoco,It is a beautiful evening.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/09_RdMo6AResurrection_Monoco,It’s a simple journey to the Sacred River.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/10_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Monoco,"It’s a stupid rule, we should just bring them all back now.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/23_RdMo4Bored_Display,It’s their own special way of displaying affection for each other.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/09_RdMo1Bragathon_Verso,"I’ll admit, I’m afraid of you.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/12_RdMo6AResurrection_Monoco,I’ll deal with Golgra later.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/01_RdMo4Bored_Monoco,"I’m bored, let’s play cards or throw some dice.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/19_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Verso,I’m going to take a walk. Can’t sleep.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/08_RdMo5Thoughts_Monoco,I’m not the one you should be apologising to.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/16_RdMo6CReunion_Golgra,I’m not.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/12_RdMo1Bragathon_Verso,I’ve missed our little excursions.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/32_RdMo2Legs_Verso,I’ve missed you.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/03_RdMo3Haircut_Verso,Just a trim. You look like an overgrown mop.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/24_RdMo6CReunion_Golgra,Let me take Noco to the Village. It’s always disorientating for the newly returned. Noco needs time to adjust.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/03_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Monoco,"Let’s make haste, I don’t want her to…",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/18_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Verso,Little spoon?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/21_RdMo2Legs_Monoco,"Look, aren’t they beautiful? Here, take a leg.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/37_RdMo2Legs_Display,"Lune comes over to shush them, but ends up joining the polishing effort. It takes a while, but they finally finish and head back to the others.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/04_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Golgra,MONOCO!,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/23_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Golgra,May you both survive this.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/09_RdMo2Legs_Verso,"Mental, eh?",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/07_RdMo3Haircut_Monoco,Mmmhmm.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/06_RdMo2Legs_Monoco,"Mmmm, yes, I knew you would appreciate them. You sir, are a true connoisseur of elegant weaponry.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/17_RdMo4Bored_Monoco,"Mmph. You’re right. Or I guess I’m right, since I said that.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/08_RdMo6CReunion_Noco,Mo- Monoco?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/22_RdMo4Bored_Display,Monoco and Verso are thrilled to have fought each other once more.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/25_RdMo1Bragathon_Display,Monoco and Verso fall back into the familiar pattern of their camaraderie.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/22_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Display,Monoco and Verso understand each other more than ever.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/A02_RdMo5Thoughts_Display,Monoco is thinking about what happened after the Paintress was expelled from the canvas.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/31_RdMo5Thoughts_Display,Monoco is touched by Verso’s willingness to endure bodily harm to raise his spirits.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/06_RdMo6DMentor_Display,Monoco seems about to cry.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/03_RdMo6CReunion_Verso,"Monoco, please shut up.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/01_RdMo3Haircut_Verso,Monoco. Let me cut your hair.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/09_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Verso,Monoco–,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/13_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Verso,My friend.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/03_RdMo4Bored_Monoco,"No, I always win. Only the weak cry foul when their skills fail them.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/19_RdMo6CReunion_Noco,No?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/01_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Verso,Noco always said that he didn’t mind waiting in the queue. Why were you so adamant about bringing him back sooner?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/05_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Monoco,"Noco found me after the Fracture. Noco raised me, taught me, protected me. It’s my turn to protect him, that’s how it works.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/25_RdMo6CReunion_Golgra,"Noco, would you like to go back to the village?",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/09_RdMo5Thoughts_Monoco,Not today.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/18_RdMo6CReunion_Monoco,"Not yet, I’m afraid. We have a mission. Do you remember our expeditioner friends?",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/17_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Monoco,Now come over here and let’s snuggle.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/21_RdMo5Thoughts_Verso,Now don’t get too arrogant.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/02_RdMo4Bored_Verso,Nuhuh. You always cheat.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/20_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Monoco,Obviously.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/29_RdMo6CReunion_Golgra,Off we go then.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/02_RdMo6CReunion_Monoco,Oh come on! You’re just afraid of losing.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/14_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Verso,Oh no…,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/18_RdMo1Bragathon_Verso,"Oh yeah, turns out living inside a snake’s belly is possible when you’re immortal. Carving my way out was a nightmare though.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/18_RdMo2Legs_Verso,"Ooh, you’re right, I feel thoroughly intimidated.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/15_RdMo3Haircut_Monoco,"Oooooooooh, yes, indeed, this is quite fetching.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/14_RdMo3Haircut_Monoco,Or we would look FANTASTIC.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/25_RdMo2Legs_Monoco,Pah! Me? I fear no Nevron! Least of all a STALACT.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/27_RdMo2Legs_Verso,Perfect! In that case…,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/21_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Monoco,Please help me.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/12_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Golgra,Plus I hate all the noise. Can you imagine a forest full of baby gestrals?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/01_RdMo2Legs_Verso,Polishing your collection of nev legs?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/05_RdMo4Bored_Monoco,Poor losers.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/15_RdMo1Bragathon_Monoco,Remember our first battle against the Duallist?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/20_RdMo1Bragathon_Verso,"Remember that time when you, uh, challenged Esquie to a duel?",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/19_RdMo1Bragathon_Verso,Remember that time you got stuck under a building for a year?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/22_RdMo2Legs_Verso,Right. Definitely not ‘cause you’re afraid of them.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/08_RdMo4Bored_Verso,"Some other time, it’s late, and you need your beauty sleep.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/23_RdMo5Thoughts_Monoco,"Sometimes I wish things could go back to how they were before. When we could play with Clea, Aline, and Renoir.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/09_RdMo4Bored_Monoco,Spoil sport. My beauty requires no sleep.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/19_RdMo2Legs_Monoco,Stalacts are too stupid to realise they should be intimidated and confused.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/09_RdMo3Haircut_Verso,"Stop being grumpy. C’mon, let’s give you some style.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/16_RdMo1Bragathon_Verso,"Sure do, we got our asses kicked pretty hard.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/05_RdMo6DMentor_Monoco,"Thank you, my friend.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/07_RdMo6CReunion_Monoco,Thank you.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/32_RdMo6CReunion_Monoco,Thanks for helping. I never understood how Golgra got so freakishly strong.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/31_RdMo6CReunion_Monoco,That he will be.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/19_RdMo5Thoughts_Monoco,That is very true.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/29_RdMo5Thoughts_Monoco,That would… warm my heart.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/16_RdMo6AResurrection_Display,"The Sacred River is not far from Monoco’s station, to the north.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/02_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Monoco,The Sacred River.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/23_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Display,The bond they share is unbreakable.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/28_RdMo2Legs_Verso,"The cleanup, eh? Mmm. Alright, well, in that case…",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/02_RdMo6AResurrection_Monoco,The colours in the sky. The shining of the stars.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/03_RdMo1Bragathon_Monoco,The mountain where a Pèlerin cut you in half and you cried for my help?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/04_RdMo4Bored_Verso,The other gestrals never wanna play with you either. Are they all weak?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/30_RdMo5Thoughts_Verso,Then let’s go get cut in half.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/02_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Monoco,There was never supposed to be a queue. Verso–,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/33_RdMo5Thoughts_Display,"They battle a few Nevrons in the middle of the night, like in the good old days, before returning to the others.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/24_RdMo4Bored_Display,"They share a few drinks, which Monoco can’t drink because of his mask, then head back to the others.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/26_RdMo1Bragathon_Display,They spend a bit more time bragging before going back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/08_RdMo6DMentor_Display,"They spend a bit more time together, as Verso cheers Monoco up. They return to the others.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/24_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Display,"They spend more time together being weird and sentimental, before returning to the others.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/20_RdMo6CReunion_Monoco,"They’ll be happy to see you. They were very worried. Come, let’s go back to camp. We found many treasures for you to trade!",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/07_RdMo6DMentor_Display,"They’ve always been best friends, but Verso and Monoco’s bond grows even stronger from their adventure.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/13_RdMo2Legs_Monoco,"Think of the intimidation, muahaha!",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/15_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Verso,"Think twice, Monoco.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/03_RdMo6AResurrection_Monoco,Tonight is a night full of promise.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/14_RdMo2Legs_Verso,True. I wouldn’t wanna battle anyone who’s using your hairy foot as a club. But more for the smell than the intimidation.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/23_RdMo2Legs_Verso,"Uh, that’s alright. I think you’ve got the intimidation factor covered.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/17_RdMo3Haircut_Display,Verso and Monoco are now bound by a manly love of style.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/00_RdMo2Legs_Display,"Verso approaches Monoco, who is carefully cleaning his Nevron legs.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/A01_RdMo5Thoughts_Display,"Verso approaches Monoco, who looks deep in thought.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/A03_RdMo6DMentor_Display,Verso approaches Monoco.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/A01_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Display,Verso approaches Monoco. He knows exactly what Monoco is thinking.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/14_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Monoco,Verso gave us many new beginnings. He would have wanted a new beginning for you too.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/A02_RdMo6DMentor_Display,"Verso knows his old friend wants to talk, even if he is too proud to admit it.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/15_RdMo6AResurrection_Display,Verso promised Monoco that they would bring Noco back.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/03_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Monoco,Verso wanted us to experience the excitement of new beginnings. He gave us the gift of the river. Why shouldn’t we use it?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/13_RdMo4Bored_Monoco,"Verso, ever gracious in defeat. Rematch?",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/28_RdMo6CReunion_Monoco,Wait for me. I’ll be back as soon as I can.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/29_RdMo2Legs_Verso,Wanna go intimidate some Stalacts? We’ve got some time to kill.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/28_RdMo5Thoughts_Verso,Want to go hunt some Nevrons we are absolutely not ready to take on like in the good old days?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/05_RdMo6AResurrection_Monoco,We shall bring Noco back.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/24_RdMo2Legs_Verso,"We wouldn’t wanna be so intimidating that the Nevs run away, right? Then we wouldn’t get to fight.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/27_RdMo5Thoughts_Verso,Well it’s up to us to make sure they go away.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/02_RdMo1Bragathon_Verso,"Well, I didn’t spend the last few years hiding in the mountains.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/22_RdMo1Bragathon_Monoco,"Well, someone conveniently forgot to mention that Esquie’s the most powerful creature in the world.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/06_RdMo1Bragathon_Verso,"Well, unlike Gestrals I need sleep, so I’ll pass.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/10_RdMo6AResurrection_Monoco,"We’re not far, it’s close to the Station.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/06_RdMo3Haircut_Verso,"We’re talking about you, not me.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/09_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Golgra,We’ve been over this before. See all these gestrals? They’re waiting in the queue like everyone else!,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/14_RdMo5Thoughts_Monoco,"When I left you ten years ago, I convinced myself that it was for the Grandis’ sake, but really, I could no longer watch the death of Expedition after Expedition.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/18_RdMo3Haircut_Display,Which they would never admit to each other.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/07_RdMo6AResurrection_Monoco,Who knows how much time tomorrow will allow. No. Let us give Noco the gift of today.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/07_RdMo2Legs_Verso,Why do you need to polish them anyway?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/11_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Verso,Why help me then? If–,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/02_RdMo3Haircut_Monoco,Why would I be foolish enough to do that?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/07_RdMo5Thoughts_Verso,Will a duel help you feel better?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/12_RdMo4Bored_Verso,"Yeah yeah, you walking hairball.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/04_RdMo1Bragathon_Verso,"Yeah, the mountain where a Stalact stomped you and I had to evacuate you.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/14_RdMo1Bragathon_Verso,"Yeah, you do too, I know.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/15_RdMo5Thoughts_Verso,Yeah… I know.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/04_RdMo2Legs_Verso,"Yes, I too find the legs of our enemies to be… beautiful.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/02_RdMo2Legs_Monoco,"Yes, aren’t they beautiful!",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/05_RdMo3Haircut_Verso,"Yes, my hair is impeccable.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/16_RdMo5Thoughts_Monoco,Yet here I am with you again. Am I loyal because that’s who I am? Or because Verso painted me that way?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/11_RdMo5Thoughts_Monoco,Yet… I share their sadness. I share their joy.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/13_RdMo5Thoughts_Verso,"You are the most loyal friend, and certainly not “just” a gestral.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/15_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Monoco,"You deserve a new beginning, if you want one. Every one of us does.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/04_RdMo6CReunion_Golgra,"You did entertain me, so… I’ll let it slide this time, Monoco.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/10_RdMo3Haircut_Monoco,You first then.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/15_RdMo4Bored_Monoco,You got lucky.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/18_RdMo4Bored_Monoco,You have grown more formidable than I remembered. Your skills are strong. I respect your win.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/13_RdMo6AResurrection_Monoco,"You helped me bring Noco back once before, will you help us again, my friend?",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/11_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Golgra,You know that would be CHAOS. There aren’t enough adult gestrals to shepherd all the newborns.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/13_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Monoco,You leave me no choice then.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/01_RdMo6DMentor_Verso,You ok?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/20_RdMo2Legs_Monoco,"You should try it. Even though you can’t transform, it will still strike fear in the hearts of our enemies!",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/05_RdMo1Bragathon_Monoco,You want to fight?,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/20_RdMo4Bored_Verso,"You were right, old friend, that was fun.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/21_RdMo7NewBeginnings_Monoco,Your loss. Esquie’s a better snuggler anyway.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/07_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Golgra,You’re carrying dozens of feet around. I can smell them from the other side of the continent.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/18_RdMo5Thoughts_Verso,"You’re not any more real than I am, that’s a reality we have to accept.",
ST_DS_RdMonoco/05_RdMo6BSacredRiver_Golgra,You’re trying to skip the queue again you old… uh… old… lazy… retired warrior!,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/17_RdMo5Thoughts_Verso,You’ve kicked my ass enough times to know that it’s just who you are.,
ST_DS_RdMonoco/34_RdMo2Legs_Monoco,[happy grumble],

ST_DS_RdNoco/25_RdNo1Patate_Noco,"Besides, I need to keep Monoco out of trouble.",
ST_DS_RdNoco/09_RdNo1Patate_Verso,Fair enough.,
ST_DS_RdNoco/02_RdNo1Patate_Noco,Hmph. How’s my favourite NOT-a-patate?,
ST_DS_RdNoco/01_RdNo1Patate_Verso,How’s my favourite patate?,
ST_DS_RdNoco/13_RdNo1Patate_Verso,"I don’t believe you. Don’t tell Monoco I said this, but you were and still are the greatest SEARCHER of all time.",
ST_DS_RdNoco/06_RdNo1Patate_Verso,Is that the official term?,
ST_DS_RdNoco/21_RdNo1Patate_Verso,It’s not always bad.,
ST_DS_RdNoco/10_RdNo1Patate_Verso,I’ll take it.,

ST_DS_RdNoco/20_RdNo1Patate_Verso,"Mmmm, true.",
ST_DS_RdNoco/26_RdNo1Patate_Verso,"Monoco’s all grown up now, and it’s your turn to be the patate.",
ST_DS_RdNoco/18_RdNo1Patate_Verso,No?,
ST_DS_RdNoco/03_RdNo1Patate_Verso,"Oh, I’m still your favourite, am I?",
ST_DS_RdNoco/07_RdNo1Patate_Noco,"Ooooooh, jealous?? You’re the one who asked me to make friends!",
ST_DS_RdNoco/22_RdNo1Patate_Noco,See?,
ST_DS_RdNoco/28_RdNo1Patate_Verso,So eloquent.,
ST_DS_RdNoco/11_RdNo1Patate_Verso,"So tell me, patate to NOT-a-patate, why are you tagging along? Really.",
ST_DS_RdNoco/23_RdNo1Patate_Noco,Wait until you’re MY age. Then we’ll talk.,
ST_DS_RdNoco/12_RdNo1Patate_Noco,What d’you mean? If I’m gonna be the GREATEST. MERCHANT. OF ALL TIME then I need to find some TREASURE.,
ST_DS_RdNoco/08_RdNo1Patate_Noco,Yes!,
ST_DS_RdNoco/19_RdNo1Patate_Noco,You know this. Forever the same SUCKS.,
ST_DS_RdNoco/29_RdNo1Patate_Noco,[mischievous laugh],
ST_DS_RdNoco/05_RdNo1Patate_Verso,‘Cause you’ve taken a real shine to Maelle.,
ST_DS_RdNoco/04_RdNo1Patate_Verso,“Not-a-patate?”,
ST_DS_RdSciel/20_RdSc1Stories_Sciel,"A bit impersonal, mm? Not really how you get to know each other. I don’t think that’s worthy of a trade.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/05_RdSc3Scars_Sciel,A good one this time?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/14_RdSc1Stories_Verso,A story for a story.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/33_RdSc6BClass_Verso,Actually. Are you feeling adventurous? How about we stay here a little longer?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/30_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,Actually. My students made these bracelets for me. To remember them by.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/25D_RdSc6BClass_Display,"After a little while, she manages to swim to the island.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/08_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,After his death I… was in a bad place.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/32_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,"Ah, and here I had prepared something truly dark and heart wrenching.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/29_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,All I can offer is another story.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/20_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,"All right then, oh wise and skillful swim captain.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/10_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,"All right, all right, let me think.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/28_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,All you’ve revealed is that you’re vain and you’re really bad at making appointments.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/48_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,"Alright, go to sleep then. I’ll go be adventurous by myself.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/03_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,An observation.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/57_RdSc6BClass_Display,And Verso appreciates being vulnerable with Sciel.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/22_RdSc6ASwimming_Display,And a lady’s swimsuit as well. Just in case.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/39_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,"And by today, I mean tonight.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/39_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,And every year you wait…,
ST_DS_RdSciel/57_RdSc7Suicide_Display,And time flew by.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/27_RdSc6BClass_Verso,And you doubted me…,
ST_DS_RdSciel/51_RdSc4Philosophy_Display,Away from the others…,
ST_DS_RdSciel/31_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,"Because chances are, we’ll never see each other again.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/59_RdSc6BClass_Display,Before heading back.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/09_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,"Being at the school, I still felt bad, but at least I could feel his presence. Hear stories about him from the kids. Continue his work.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/53_RdSc7Suicide_Display,Bound by grief and dark thoughts…,
ST_DS_RdSciel/37_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,But I don’t know how to tell him I lost our baby.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/23_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,But he’s always napping when I get there and his apprentice always mucks things up. I’m lucky my hair’s not purple this time.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/17_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,But if you had asked me back then…,
ST_DS_RdSciel/47_RdSc7Suicide_Verso,But there is a creature that Verso painted into his canvas. One who always helps people when they become consumed by their dark thoughts.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/31_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,"But… I woke up the next day in Lumière, on the docks.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/24_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,Can you mention my wisdom to Monoco sometime?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/04_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso,Clearly.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/50_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,Come back with a better story next time.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/05_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,"Come on, you’ve been alive for over 60 years, you must have tons of stories.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/15_RdSc6BClass_Verso,Come on. Let me help.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/11_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,Dead flowers are nice too.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/10_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,Death is a friend who will welcome me home.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/28_RdSc3Scars_Verso,Deep.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/55_RdSc4Philosophy_Display,"Despite that, she feels closer to Verso.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/02_RdSc6ASwimming_Sciel,Did Esquie put you up to this?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/45_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,Do you even need to ask?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/17_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,Does it matter? How you view things is up to you. Life continues either way.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/48_RdSc6BClass_Verso,Don’t be. Let’s head back.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/04_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,Double the efficiency. You should see how quickly I can harvest crops.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/10_RdSc6BClass_Verso,"Esquie fed me so many mushrooms. I died the first few times, but now I’m immune.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/05_RdSc6ASwimming_Sciel,Esquie’s been nagging me incessantly about swimming lessons.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/06_RdSc6ASwimming_Sciel,Esquie’s such a little trickster! He keeps trying to get me into the water.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/20_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,"Every day, I just felt the LACK of him. The negative space he used to inhabit.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/07_RdSc6BClass_Verso,Exposure. Avoiding just makes it worse.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/01_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,"For the record, I do know how to swim. I mean, I grew up on an island.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/22_RdSc1Stories_Verso,"Going straight for the heavy stuff, huh?",
ST_DS_RdSciel/09_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,He brought me a bouquet of them. AND 15 boxes of plant cuttings.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/07_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso,He did say you’re a terrible swimmer.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/23_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,He died in an accident on one of the islands near Lumière. His body washed away.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/35_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,Her parents did the maths. They’ll have 12 years as a family. And she’ll experience 21 years of life.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/01_RdSc3Scars_Sciel,Here to make amends for your terrible story?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/16_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,"Hey, I’m sharing a heartfelt secret here. Do you want the story or not?",
ST_DS_RdSciel/13_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,Hm. Life is easier when you think of death as a friend.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/31_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,Hmm. I’m not really in the mood for stories tonight.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/02_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,Hmm. Let me think.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/12_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,Home?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/22_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,How kind of you to acknowledge my wisdom.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/12_RdSc6ASwimming_Sciel,How very gallant of you.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/21_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,I am indeed very wise.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/09_RdSc3Scars_Verso,"I could heal it, but I don’t.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/03_RdSc3Scars_Sciel,I could tell. I’m not really sure you’re up to the challenge.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/36_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,"I desperately want Maelle to bring everyone back, to bring Pierre back.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/26_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,I did it! I can’t believe that worked! Thank you.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/47_RdSc6BClass_Verso,I do have excellent technique.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/40_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,"I do think we should spend the night here, though.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/18_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,"I don’t know. If there is, then I’ll see everyone after death. And if there isn’t, I’ll simply join them in death. I’ll be with them, either way.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/44_RdSc6BClass_Verso,I don’t think that’s a good idea. For me.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/13_RdSc3Scars_Sciel,I feel like there’s more to this story.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/40_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,I feel used. But I like it.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/09_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,I gave you a topic. “Dark and personal.”,
ST_DS_RdSciel/17_RdSc6ASwimming_Sciel,I guess it is a good idea though.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/08_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,I guess that’s true for me too.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/02_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,"I guess yeah, once a farmer, always a farmer.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/07_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,"I guess… Death and I, we’ve walked a long road together.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/04_RdSc6BClass_Verso,"I had an aversion to Monoco, but I got over it.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/05_RdSc6BClass_Verso,"I had an aversion to mushrooms, but I got over it.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/19_RdSc3Scars_Verso,"I had to walk away, but he was… resistant.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/34_RdSc3Scars_Sciel,I knew it.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/33_RdSc3Scars_Verso,"I know, that’s the real reason I keep them.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/07_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,"I need a topic, I can’t just spit out stories on command.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/23_RdSc3Scars_Verso,I never thought of it that way… but you’re right.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/08_RdSc6BClass_Verso,I tied myself to Monoco for a month and we spent every minute of the day together.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/25_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,I tried to drown myself.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/28_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,"I tried to swim away from Lumière. I swam for as long as I could, as far as the waves would carry me.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/11_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,I understand why your mother did what she did.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/43_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,I understand. Good night.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/06_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,I used to love the gardens of Lumière. It must look quite different now.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/32_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,I was alive… and I have no idea what happened.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/12_RdSc6BClass_Verso,I was also the swim captain at school…,
ST_DS_RdSciel/25_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,I was prepared for his Gommage. But not for him to die in an accident.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/19_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,I would have done anything to see him again. To hear his voice. To feel his arms around me.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/23_RdSc1Stories_Sciel,"If we’re going to share, let’s share.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/16_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,"If you asked me now, then no. I’ve seen how this torments you. I wouldn’t wish that on others.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/22_RdSc3Scars_Sciel,"If you can control your healing, that means Renoir can too. And he made the same choice as you. Interesting.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/03_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,Is a double-headed scythe very useful on a farm though?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/15_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,Is it. Or are you just dressing it up to manage your fear?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/02_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,Is that a question?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/13_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,Is that supposed to be impressive? That you swam with other kids 100 years ago?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/02_RdSc1Stories_Sciel,Is that your conclusion? After your… extensive observation of our team?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/37_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,Is there a future where I might… compete… in the same event?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/51_RdSc6BClass_Display,It is truly passionate.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/46_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,It is.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/18_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso,It is. Go get changed and meet me at the lake.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/21_RdSc3Scars_Verso,It was the first time we ever raised a hand against the other.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/25_RdSc3Scars_Sciel,It was worthy.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/32_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,It was… something.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/43_RdSc7Suicide_Verso,It would solve a lot of problems. For everyone.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/45_RdSc7Suicide_Verso,"It’s a choice, like any other choice.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/11_RdSc3Scars_Verso,It’s a reminder of the price I paid to stand on my own two feet. But it meant walking away from people I cared about.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/17_RdSc6BClass_Verso,It’s about control.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/16_RdSc6BClass_Verso,It’s about fear.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/14_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,It’s about my hair.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/05_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,It’s good that you can admit I’m smarter.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/02_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,It’s just I have… an aversion to swimming.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/17_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,It’s just… it still hurts that he’s gone.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/29_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,"It’s ok. I’ve learned to be grateful for the time we did have, instead of angry at the time we lost.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/16_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,It’s ok…,
ST_DS_RdSciel/14_RdSc3Scars_Sciel,"It’s probably not a coincidence then, that Renoir has a similar scar?",
ST_DS_RdSciel/43_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,"I’ll admit, it’s been awhile.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/02_RdSc3Scars_Verso,"I’ll be honest, I didn’t expect things to get so deep so fast.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/05_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,I’ll bet.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/09_RdSc1Stories_Verso,"I’ll trade you. A story for a story. Quite fair, I think.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/14_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso,I’m a team player. But nobody enjoys sitting in wet clothes.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/23_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,I’m about three times your age so I’m pretty much three times as wise.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/37_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,I’m afraid things are different now.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/30_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,I’m all ears.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/33_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,I’m an optimist but I’m also a realist.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/01_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso,"I’m going for a swim with Esquie, care to join?",
ST_DS_RdSciel/03_RdSc7Suicide_Verso,"I’m not as smart as you, you’ll have to connect the dots for me.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/12_RdSc1Stories_Sciel,"I’m pretty sure you actually enjoy being mysterious. But alright, give us a story then.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/39_RdSc7Suicide_Verso,I’m so sorry.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/24_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,I’m sorry.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/46_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,I’m sorry.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/14_RdSc6BClass_Verso,"I’m still a good swimmer now, it’s not something you forget.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/39_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,I’m waiting for you to connect the dots.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/41_RdSc7Suicide_Verso,I’ve… had similar thoughts before.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/22_RdSc6BClass_Verso,Just sit here in the water for a little bit.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/43_RdSc6BClass_Verso,Let’s celebrate.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/38_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,Let’s just focus on today.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/21_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,Luckily the Gestral Village has a hairstylist quite skilled in colour treatments.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/22_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,Lucky.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/04_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,"Lune’s intense and obsessed, Maelle is nervous and eager. But you, you’re calm.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/38_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,Maelle can bring Pierre back. I’m sorry.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/16_RdSc3Scars_Verso,"Maelle’s right, you really do see everything.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/10_RdSc7Suicide_Verso,Mmm. Makes sense.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/25_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,"Mmmm, yes. You must have many pearls to offer.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/34_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,"My youngest student is six. Her parents will gommage when she’s 12, and she herself won’t live past 21.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/19_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,"Neither of us were perfect, but we were perfect for each other.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/43_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,"No, I don’t. But I have my students.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/21_RdSc1Stories_Sciel,"No, tell me something dark and melancholy. And personal.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/07_RdSc3Scars_Sciel,"No, you said you’re vain.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/10_RdSc1Stories_Verso,"No, you’re right, what was I thinking? It’s better to stay mysterious.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/42_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,Not counting Monoco?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/32_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,Not necessarily…,
ST_DS_RdSciel/42_RdSc7Suicide_Verso,"Not of drowning specifically, but… you know.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/29_RdSc6BClass_Verso,"Now, let’s see you swim back.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/03_RdSc6BClass_Verso,"Oh, I can help you with that.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/04_RdSc3Scars_Verso,"Oh, I can keep up. In fact, I’m here to offer a story.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/26_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,"Oh, actually isn’t Monoco even older? Esquie too. Perhaps I should ask them instead.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/06_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,"Oh, do share your secrets then.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/08_RdSc1Stories_Sciel,"Oh, is that what this is?",
ST_DS_RdSciel/34_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,Oh.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/13_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,Oh. I’m so intrigued.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/39_RdSc6BClass_Verso,"Oh. No, right, of course. I understand, don’t worry.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/10_RdSc3Scars_Sciel,Oh. Why is that?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/40_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,Ohhh. You mean… adventure.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/12_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,"Okay, I’m going to share something deeply personal with you.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/11_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,"Okay, I’m going to share something really dark with you.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/19_RdSc6ASwimming_Sciel,Okay.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/44_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,"One of my friends, Sophie, said it best.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/16_RdSc1Stories_Sciel,Only if it’s a good one. You first.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/42_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,Our time together was special to me. Let’s celebrate it one last time.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/06_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,"Over 100 years, actually, so it’s hard to choose.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/07_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,"Pierre… used to volunteer at the school, teaching the kids how to sail and survive in the wild.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/28_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,Please do. You’ll probably learn valuable things about Nevron feet and rocks.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/17_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,Please. Do share.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/41_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,Precisely.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/07_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,Probably a lot more variety than back then. The Outdome teams brought back loads of new plants from the surrounding islands.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/24_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,Purple could be fun.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/27_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,"Sadly, no pearls.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/33_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,Save it for tomorrow. Let’s do something else tonight.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/06_RdSc1Stories_Sciel,Says the mysterious stranger who has yet to share much about himself.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/52_RdSc6BClass_Display,Sciel and Verso experience something unforgettable.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/49_RdSc5Pierre_Display,Sciel and Verso find a nice spot away from the group.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/32C_RdSc6BClass_Display,Sciel and Verso know that they can always rely on each other.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/52_RdSc2Bracelets_Display,"Sciel and Verso spend a bit too long teasing each other, before going back to the others.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/38_RdSc3Scars_Display,"Sciel and Verso switch to sillier topics for a few minutes, before heading back to the others.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/48_RdSc5Pierre_Display,Sciel and Verso’s bond grows even deeper.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/36_RdSc3Scars_Display,Sciel appreciates that Verso opened up to her.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/32A_RdSc6BClass_Display,Sciel can’t believe she has overcome her fear.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/27_RdSc1Stories_Display,"Sciel continues to tease Verso, who remains evasive.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/56_RdSc6BClass_Display,Sciel feels grateful that Verso helped her overcome her fear.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/25A_RdSc6BClass_Display,Sciel gathers her courage and enters the water.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/52_RdSc7Suicide_Display,Sciel has confided her darkest secret to Verso.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/53_RdSc4Philosophy_Display,Sciel is disappointed that Verso declined her invitation.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/52_RdSc5Pierre_Display,Sciel is unable to save Verso from Lune’s displeasure.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/54_RdSc5Pierre_Display,Sciel sees a good friend in Verso.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/35_RdSc7Suicide_Verso,Sciel…,
ST_DS_RdSciel/48_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,See? Dark AND personal.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/32B_RdSc6BClass_Display,She appreciates Verso’s friendship.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/25C_RdSc6BClass_Display,She begins to feel more at ease.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/37_RdSc3Scars_Display,She feels closer to Verso now.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/25B_RdSc6BClass_Display,"She panics, but Verso helps her get over her fear.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/45_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,"She said… she loves her children so much, the best thing she can do for them…",
ST_DS_RdSciel/13_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,"She wanted to feel closer to her son, to still feel Verso’s presence.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/38_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,She would have been six.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/54_RdSc4Philosophy_Display,"She’s not used to being rejected, but she doesn’t take it personally.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/10_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,"Smart man. If you want to romance a farmer, live plants are probably better than dead flowers.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/23_RdSc6ASwimming_Display,Sneaky Verso.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/04_RdSc7Suicide_Verso,So obvious.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/12_RdSc3Scars_Verso,So there you have it. “Dark and personal.”,
ST_DS_RdSciel/31_RdSc6BClass_Verso,So you admit it was inspirational.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/25_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,So. Your turn.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/24_RdSc3Scars_Verso,So. “Dark and personal” enough for you?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/44_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,So?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/18_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,"Some time after the Fracture, my hair turned completely white. Like…",
ST_DS_RdSciel/17_RdSc1Stories_Verso,Something epic then? Full of battle and danger?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/18_RdSc1Stories_Verso,Something unusual then? Strange wonders and mysteries?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/15_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,Sorry.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/24_RdSc1Stories_Verso,"Story for a story, right?",
ST_DS_RdSciel/01_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,Story time?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/34_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,That I had lost the child.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/35_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,That depends. How adventurous are you feeling?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/41_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,That might not be a good idea. I don’t know if I can keep my feelings casual.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/26_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,That was hardly dark or personal.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/11_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso,That way you can save me if I fall into the water.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/10_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso,"That way, if you fall into the water, I don’t have to ruin my clothes jumping in after you.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/30_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,That’s a good way to look at it.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/35_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,That’s a nice way to say “fling.”,
ST_DS_RdSciel/29_RdSc3Scars_Sciel,That’s a story for another time.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/08_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,That’s actually how I met Pierre. I asked his team for honeypetal samples.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/19_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,That’s an interesting philosophy for someone so young.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/49_RdSc4Philosophy_Display,The bond between Sciel and Verso deepens.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/21_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,"The dip in the chair where he sat, the hollow of his shoes, the emptiness inside his jacket.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/38_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,"The earlier you have children, the more time you get to share with them, and the more life they’ll get to live.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/32_RdSc3Scars_Sciel,"The scars look good on you, though.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/54_RdSc7Suicide_Display,Their connection deepens.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/07_RdSc1Stories_Verso,Then consider this my attempt to be less mysterious.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/32E_RdSc6BClass_Display,Then head back to the group.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/23_RdSc6BClass_Verso,"Then when you’re comfortable, we’ll go a bit deeper. Then a bit deeper still.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/04_RdSc1Stories_Sciel,There must be better uses of your time than analysing our stress levels.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/37_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,These are the choices we get to make.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/54_RdSc6BClass_Display,They are exhausted so the swim is more complicated.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/29_RdSc1Stories_Display,They head back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/30C_RdSc4Philosophy_Display,They head back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/56_RdSc4Philosophy_Display,They head back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/56_RdSc5Pierre_Display,They head back to the others.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/51_RdSc5Pierre_Display,They return to camp. Lune is upset that Verso skipped sentry duty.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/32D_RdSc6BClass_Display,"They spend a bit of time on the island together, celebrating.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/50_RdSc5Pierre_Display,They spend an unusually long time together.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/53_RdSc6BClass_Display,They spend hours on the island before swimming back.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/50_RdSc6BClass_Display,They spend one final night together.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/58_RdSc6BClass_Display,"They spend some time in the water together, having fun.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/55_RdSc5Pierre_Display,They spend some time together discussing past loves.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/11_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,This is your idea of an inspirational story?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/51_RdSc2Bracelets_Display,"Though Verso’s story was rather lacking, Sciel appreciates Verso slightly more than before.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/53_RdSc5Pierre_Display,"Though disappointed, Sciel understands Verso’s feelings.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/45_RdSc5Pierre_Display,"Though she doesn’t show it, Verso knows that she appreciates the support.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/20_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,"True, I’m not quite as old as you. Why don’t you share some of the wisdom you’ve accumulated over your very long life.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/08_RdSc6ASwimming_Sciel,Tsk. Esquie.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/56_RdSc7Suicide_Display,"Two close friends, able to enjoy the silence together.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/46_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,"Um, actually I’m a bit sleepy.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/29_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,Until I could no longer swim.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/24_RdSc6BClass_Verso,Until we get to the trees on the island there.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/29_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,"Vain? I’m not– Hey, I’m not the one with all the… bracelets and rings.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/52_RdSc4Philosophy_Display,Verso and Sciel became a bit more than friends.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/30B_RdSc4Philosophy_Display,Verso and Sciel feel like friends.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/20_RdSc6ASwimming_Display,Verso and Sciel get changed.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/55_RdSc6BClass_Display,Verso and Sciel share a particularly emotional moment.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/47_RdSc5Pierre_Display,Verso and Sciel spend more time together before joining the others.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/55_RdSc7Suicide_Display,"Verso and Sciel spend more time together, looking at the stars.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/30A_RdSc4Philosophy_Display,Verso and Sciel spend some time sharing silly stories with each other.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/50_RdSc4Philosophy_Display,Verso and Sciel spend some time together.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/26_RdSc1Stories_Display,Verso and Sciel spend the next few minutes arguing whether Sciel should also share.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/49_RdSc6BClass_Display,Verso and Sciel stay on the island.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/46_RdSc5Pierre_Display,Verso and Sciel understand each other.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/28_RdSc1Stories_Display,Verso and Sciel’s relationship grows a little bit.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/00_RdSc6ASwimming_Display,Verso approaches Sciel with conviction.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/00_RdSc7Suicide_Display,"Verso approaches Sciel, eager to talk to her.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/00_RdSc1Stories_Display,"Verso approaches Sciel, who seems open to talking.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/21_RdSc6ASwimming_Display,Verso reveals that he keeps secret swimsuits in Monoco’s bag.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/44_RdSc5Pierre_Display,Verso stays a bit longer with Sciel.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/35_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,Verso…,
ST_DS_RdSciel/44_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,Verso…,
ST_DS_RdSciel/19_RdSc1Stories_Sciel,We get plenty of that on a daily basis. You can go brag with Monoco instead.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/19_RdSc6BClass_Verso,"We need to help you feel in control of the situation, give you time and space to react and not panic.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/18_RdSc6BClass_Verso,We need to help your body and your mind realise that there’s nothing to fear and no reason to panic.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/26_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,We were supposed to have five more years together.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/33_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,"Well, I can’t compete with that.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/09_RdSc6BClass_Verso,"Well, Noco tied us together, but anyway. Now we’re best friends.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/05_RdSc1Stories_Verso,"Well, it’s important to understand your teammates.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/27_RdSc3Scars_Sciel,"Well, we all have scars that won’t heal, don’t we?",
ST_DS_RdSciel/09_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso,"Well, you always seem uneasy when we travel over water. You should learn to swim.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/11_RdSc1Stories_Sciel,Well. There are stories and then there are “stories.”,
ST_DS_RdSciel/25_RdSc1Stories_Sciel,We’ll see.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/33_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,"What I didn’t know then… What the hospital told me… was that I was pregnant. But that I had, um…",
ST_DS_RdSciel/34_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,What do you have in mind?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/09_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,What does that mean?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/03_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso,What ever do you mean?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/21_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,What first?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/20_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,What happened to him?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/15_RdSc6ASwimming_Verso,What happened to teamwork? What if I’m injured or unconscious?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/02_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,"What, it’s not obvious?",
ST_DS_RdSciel/30_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,"What, no inspirational pep talk this time?",
ST_DS_RdSciel/26_RdSc7Suicide_Verso,What?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/38_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,What?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/36_RdSc6BClass_Verso,What’s wrong?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/27_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,"When I lost Pierre, I…",
ST_DS_RdSciel/27_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,White hair. Old man. I’m revealing myself here.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/05_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,Why is that strange?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/26_RdSc3Scars_Verso,Worthy of the story of that scar on your stomach?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/08_RdSc3Scars_Verso,Would a vain person keep this scar?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/14_RdSc7Suicide_Verso,"Would you have created a copy of Pierre, if you could? Knowing it wouldn’t be the real thing?",
ST_DS_RdSciel/32_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,Yeah. I am… very lucky.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/18_RdSc3Scars_Verso,"Yeah. We disagreed on pretty much everything. Tactics, goals… what lines we wouldn’t cross.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/49_RdSc7Suicide_Verso,"Yes, him.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/14_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,"Yes, home. With everyone I’ve ever loved.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/06_RdSc3Scars_Verso,"Yes, well… you said I’m vain.",
ST_DS_RdSciel/03_RdSc1Stories_Verso,Yes.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/28_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,You are indeed an excellent swimmer and teacher.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/16_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,You believe in an afterlife?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/13_RdSc6ASwimming_Sciel,You can save yourself.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/45_RdSc6BClass_Sciel,You can show me your other swim moves.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/41_RdSc6BClass_Verso,You do?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/42_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,You don’t have any children though.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/22_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,You don’t have to talk about it.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/13_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,You don’t talk about your husband much.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/15_RdSc1Stories_Sciel,You first then.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/20_RdSc3Scars_Sciel,You fought?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/36_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,You mean like hunt Nevrons?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/48_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,You mean…,
ST_DS_RdSciel/01_RdSc7Suicide_Verso,You never told me… How do you go from being a farmer to running a school?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/15_RdSc3Scars_Verso,You noticed that?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/01_RdSc1Stories_Verso,You seem less stressed than the others.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/01_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,You used to be a farmer? Is that why you use a scythe?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/23_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,You want to know why I dislike water?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/31_RdSc5Pierre_Verso,You were lucky to have found each other. Not everyone has that.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/15_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,Your hair? That’s a bit literal on “dark” and “personal.”,
ST_DS_RdSciel/16_RdSc6ASwimming_Sciel,Your hypothetical situation is quite specific.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/08_RdSc2Bracelets_Sciel,You’re 100 years old and so indecisive?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/01_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,You’re always so calm about everything.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/34_RdSc5Pierre_Sciel,You’re competing in a different event.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/41_RdSc4Philosophy_Sciel,You’ve been alone too long on this continent. When was the last time you seduced someone?,
ST_DS_RdSciel/49_RdSc2Bracelets_Verso,You’ve set the bar high.,
ST_DS_RdSciel/40_RdSc7Suicide_Sciel,"“Dark and personal,” right?",
ST_DS_RdSciel/11_RdSc4Philosophy_Verso,“Friend’s” not the word I’d choose.,

Paint a new number.

Ticking down every year.

One stroke... And everyone of that age vanishes into nothingness.

Every year she paints again. And every year an expedition departs for the continent.

With one hopeless mission.

Destroy the Paintress

So she can never paint death again.

We... are Expedition 33.",

ST_IWD_AncientSanctuary/02_SakapatateA_Lune,How do they even stand?,
ST_IWD_AncientSanctuary/01_SakapatateA_Gustave,These things are fascinating–,
ST_IWD_AncientSanctuary/02_PathToUltimateSakapatate_Maelle,They built it to make their village harder to find.,
ST_IWD_AncientSanctuary/01_PathToUltimateSakapatate_Lune,This place is confusing.,
ST_IWD_EsquieNest/03_EntryEsquiesNest_Gustave,"Are you ok, Maelle?",
ST_IWD_EsquieNest/02_EntryEsquiesNest_Lune,Esquie is said to feed on light.,
ST_IWD_EsquieNest/01_BackToEsquie_Lune,François and Esquie are very different from Gestrals and Nevrons.,
ST_IWD_EsquieNest/02_HallwayBetweenLairs_Sciel,Hmm.,
ST_IWD_EsquieNest/04_EntryEsquiesNest_Maelle,I dunno. Getting a bit of… déjà vu again.,
ST_IWD_EsquieNest/03_BackToEsquie_Lune,"If not, who else?",
ST_IWD_EsquieNest/01_EntryEsquiesNest_Sciel,Interesting decor.,
ST_IWD_EsquieNest/04_BackToEsquie_Sciel,Maybe they came from another world.,
ST_IWD_EsquieNest/05_EntryEsquiesNest_Sciel,The light here– Feels a little– I dunno– Yeah.,
ST_IWD_EsquieNest/01_HallwayBetweenLairs_Lune,"The more information we get, the more questions I have.",
ST_IWD_EsquieNest/04_HallwayBetweenLairs_Sciel,Yeah. Esquie is… surprising.,
ST_IWD_EsquieNest/03_HallwayBetweenLairs_Gustave,You okay Sciel?,
ST_IWD_EsquieNest/02_BackToEsquie_Gustave,You think the Paintress created them too?,
ST_IWD_ForgottenBattlefield/02_ArriveBattlefield_Verso,A single Nevron took out most of them.,
ST_IWD_ForgottenBattlefield/02_ExitQuarry_Lune,And no sign of your special Nevron.,
ST_IWD_ForgottenBattlefield/01_PostGcTutorial_Lune,Any other tricks we should know?,
ST_IWD_ForgottenBattlefield/03_ExitQuarry_Verso,Guess we’re lucky.,

ST_IWD_ForgottenBattlefield/01_BurialSite_Maelle,Is this the place?,
ST_IWD_ForgottenBattlefield/04_ArriveBattlefield_Verso,"I’ve only seen him once, many years ago, so most likely not.",
ST_IWD_ForgottenBattlefield/01_ExitQuarry_Sciel,Looks like we passed the danger zone.,
ST_IWD_ForgottenBattlefield/02_PostGcTutorial_Verso,One thing at a time.,
ST_IWD_ForgottenBattlefield/01_ArriveBattlefield_Sciel,These are all… Expeditions?,
ST_IWD_ForgottenBattlefield/02_BurialSite_Verso,"Yeah. We can bury your friend under this tree, if that’s okay with you.",
ST_IWD_GestralVillage/03_GVEntrance_Maelle,I guess intelligence is not a prerequisite for survival on the continent. Now to find the chief's house. Probably the biggest one.,
ST_IWD_GestralVillage/01_GVEntrance_Lune,It's… it's really a village of Gestrals!,
ST_IWD_GestralVillage/02_GVEntrance_Gustave,They seem better at surviving than humans.,
ST_IWD_Goblu/02_BourgeonTrio_Maelle,Avoid those at all costs.,
ST_IWD_Goblu/02_LustersIntro_Gustave,Doesn’t matter. They’re between us and Maelle.,
ST_IWD_Goblu/01_68Boat_Gustave,Guess we found 68’s boat.,
ST_IWD_Goblu/02_DeadNevronZone_Maelle,Guess.,
ST_IWD_Goblu/01_Cruler_Lune,It’s forging something- So they have intelligence.,
ST_IWD_Goblu/01_BourgeonTrio_Gustave,Merde. This one is gigantic–,
ST_IWD_Goblu/02_MeltingPotZone_Gustave,Our resident cynic is now a poet.,
ST_IWD_Goblu/01_NocosHut_Gustave,Over there! A hut.,
ST_IWD_Goblu/02_NocosHut_Lune,"Slow down, we don’t know what’s inside yet.",
ST_IWD_Goblu/01_CrulerDeadBodies_Gustave,So many– I don’t like this–,
ST_IWD_Goblu/03_DeadNevronZone_Gustave,So you didn’t just stay in your mansion.,
ST_IWD_Goblu/03_68Boat_Lune,That anchor doesn’t look man made…,
ST_IWD_Goblu/02_68Boat_Maelle,There’s a path through the boat.,
ST_IWD_Goblu/01_DeadNevronZone_Lune,These dead Nevrons– Who could’ve done this?,
ST_IWD_Goblu/01_MeltingPotZone_Maelle,"This building has a certain melancholy beauty. A lone outpost of humanity, nestled amongst the corals. A sailor lost at sea.",
ST_IWD_Goblu/01_ShakingMinesIntro_Lune,Those mines– Be careful.,
ST_IWD_Goblu/01_LustersIntro_Lune,"Wait, Nevron. Looks like a different species.",
ST_IWD_Goblu/03_MeltingPotZone_Maelle,Wouldn’t expect a cartesian engineer to understand beauty.,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/02_RenoirCreation_Monoco,A most enticing challenge.,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/01_LumiereOpera_Verso,Ah. The opera house…,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/01_LumiereAlmostThere_Verso,Almost there.,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/02_ChromaSphere_Sciel,Even I can sense him…,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/02_LumiereOpera_Monoco,Hmm.,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/02_LumiereAlmostThere_Maelle,Hm…,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/04_LumiereAlmostThere_Maelle,Let’s go.,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/02_AxonNevrons_Maelle,"Like Axons, they’re Papa’s creations, not Clea’s.",
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/03_LumiereAlmostThere_Sciel,Maelle?,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/03_LumiereRenoirTower_Lune,Maelle…,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/01_AxonNevrons_Sciel,Nevrons from the Axon Islands! What are they doing here?,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/01_Exp32_Sciel,No… The 32s…,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/01_RenoirRadar_Maelle,Papa is somewhere past the gardens.,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/01_ChromaSphere_Maelle,Papa’s over there. And the chroma we need to bring back Lumière.,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/02_ExpKickass_Maelle,The “Sword of Lumière.”,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/01_ExpKickass_Monoco,These expeditioners are glorious wreakers of havoc!,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/03_ChromaSphere_Lune,We’d better make sure we’re ready.,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/02_LumiereRenoirTower_Maelle,Yes.,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/01_LumiereRenoirTower_Verso,Your father. He’s at the tower.,
ST_IWD_GrandFinale/01_RenoirCreation_Sciel,Your father’s been extra inspired.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_LuMaelleA_Maelle,"All right let's go, I'll accompany you there.",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_LuMaelleF_Maelle,"All right, we're almost there.",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/02_LuMaelleA_Maelle,Are you… ready to see her again?,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/03_LuMaelleG_Maelle,But clearly you never got over her.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_LuMaelleC_Maelle,"Come on Gustave, speed up a bit.",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/02_LuMaelleB_Maelle,"Don't tell your sister, though. I sort of ""borrowed"" the hooks from the Expedition Academy.",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/04_LuMaelleA_Maelle,Gustave…,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/05_LuMaelleD_Gustave,Hm. I can imagine.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_FestivalLeaveApprentices_Gustave,"Hmm, where are my scallywag apprentices? I promised to find them at the festival.",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_LuMaelleD_Maelle,I can't believe Sophie already turned 33…,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_SophieA_Gustave,I can’t imagine what you’re going through…,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/07_SophieB_Gustave,I couldn’t do it.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/02_LuMaelleG_Maelle,I don't really understand. You and Sophie broke up so long ago.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_LuMaelleB_Maelle,"I set up these grapple shortcuts. Nice, huh?",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_FestivalLeaveMaelle_Gustave,"I should check on Maelle, she’s probably alone, as usual.",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/03_SophieD_Gustave,If you say so.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/08_SophieB_Sophie,It’s ok. You don’t have to.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/06_SophieB_Sophie,It’s one of the few choices I can make.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/04_SophieA_Sophie,I’m FINE. I’ve lived 33 good years. Look around. We’ve had our whole lives to prepare. We’re all fine.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/02_SophieA_Sophie,I’m fine.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/06_SophieA_Gustave,I’m not fine.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_SophieC_Sophie,I’ve always loved the Harbour.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_PostFestivalCs_Gustave,Let’s at least check on Maelle and my apprentices.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/03_SophieB_Sophie,Look at her. She looks… sad. Maybe she’s a prisoner too. Stuck in the same cycle with us.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/03_LuMaelleC_Gustave,Maelle.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/05_SophieA_Sophie,Mostly.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_FestivalLeaveEmma_Gustave,"My darling sister has arrived, she’ll kill me if I don’t say goodbye.",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_LuMaelleE_Maelle,Oh the Plaza is lively.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_SophieD_Sophie,"Oh, Lune's playing.",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/05_SophieB_Gustave,Only you could choose empathy at a moment like this.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/04_SophieD_Sophie,Or maybe… Something already happened huh?,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/02_LuMaelleD_Maelle,She looks so much younger than you.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/04_LuMaelleD_Maelle,"She's popular, I'm sure she already has a necklace full of flowers.",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/04_SophieB_Sophie,"Silly, huh?",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_SophieB_Sophie,Sometimes I feel sorry for her.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/02_LuMaelleC_Maelle,Sophie will have already gommaged by the time you've arrived.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/03_LuMaelleD_Gustave,Thanks.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/01_LuMaelleG_Maelle,The red and white tree… I've always found it beautiful.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/02_SophieB_Gustave,"Who, the– The Paintress??",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/02_LuMaelleE_Maelle,"Why people like to celebrate the Gommage is still a mystery to me, but oh well.",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/04_LuMaelleG_Maelle,"Why'd you wait until today to say something? It's a bit late, isn't it?",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/03_LuMaelleB_Maelle,Wish I had them when I was working as a courier…,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/03_LuMaelleA_Gustave,"Yeah, been ready.",
ST_IWD_Lumiere/02_LuMaelleF_Gustave,Yeah…,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/02_SophieD_Sophie,You two would make a cute couple.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/07_SophieA_Sophie,You will be.,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/03_SophieA_Gustave,[sceptical grunt],
ST_IWD_Lumiere/05_LuMaelleG_Gustave,…,
ST_IWD_Lumiere/05_SophieD_Gustave,…,
ST_IWD_LumiereMayhem/01_CleaCall2_Clea,"Alicia, quit dawdling. End of the corridor, you know where it is.",
ST_IWD_LumiereMayhem/01_CleaCall1_Clea,"Come along now, I’m in Renoir’s atelier.",
ST_IWD_LumiereMayhem/03_PapaListens_Verso,He’ll want you to go home.,
ST_IWD_LumiereMayhem/05_PapaListens_Verso,Hmm.,
ST_IWD_LumiereMayhem/02_PapaListens_Maelle,"I hid the Canvas before I entered, so Maman can’t come back again. There’s no need to erase the Canvas anymore.",
ST_IWD_LumiereMayhem/04_PapaListens_Maelle,"I’m not at risk like Maman. I haven’t been in this Canvas that long. Besides, Papa has a soft spot for me, he’ll listen.",
ST_IWD_LumiereMayhem/01_PapaListens_Verso,Your father was the one erasing everyone. Why would he help repaint everything?,
ST_IWD_Manor/04_MaelleManor1_Maelle,"A message? Maybe… No, I don’t know.",
ST_IWD_Manor/03_MaelleManor1_Lune,Do you know who left it?,
ST_IWD_Manor/01_MaelleManor1_Maelle,How did you find me?,
ST_IWD_Manor/02_MaelleManor1_Gustave,There was a message at the Indigo Tree.,
ST_IWD_Manor/01_AfterMaelleJoins_Maelle,"We should use the Curator’s help as much as possible, his Pictos reinforcement is really useful.",
ST_IWD_MonocoStation/02_MSEntrance_Maelle,A train. Gustave would have liked to see that.,
ST_IWD_MonocoStation/04_MSEntrance_Verso,"Always running late, but running, yes.",
ST_IWD_MonocoStation/01_MSEntrance_Verso,"Follow the tracks, they’ll lead us to Monoco.",
ST_IWD_MonocoStation/01_StationFirstView_Verso,Here we are. Monoco’s Station.,
ST_IWD_MonocoStation/03_PostGradAttack_Verso,"Hey, I taught you the Gradient Counter already. I’m not a certified combat instructor.",
ST_IWD_MonocoStation/04_PostGradAttack_Monoco,He’s just lazy. Gradient Attacks require too much energy for him.,
ST_IWD_MonocoStation/03_StationFirstView_Lune,I knew it! They’re real too!,
ST_IWD_MonocoStation/03_MSEntrance_Lune,"Is it true, before the Fracture, Lumière had trains running throughout the continent?",
ST_IWD_MonocoStation/02_StationFirstView_Lune,Is that a Grandis?,
ST_IWD_MonocoStation/01_PostGradAttack_Lune,"This is fantastic, Monoco, thank you.",
ST_IWD_MonocoStation/02_PostGradAttack_Lune,"Verso, why didn’t you show us earlier?",
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/01_MonoGoblu_Lune,Again…,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/04_MonolithEntrance_Sciel,"Are you alright, Maelle?",
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/03_MonoSm_Maelle,Fire. Again.,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/02_MonoFb_Sciel,Her husband?,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/02_MonoSeaCliff_Lune,How do you know that?,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/08_MonolithEntrance_Maelle,"I don’t know, but I can sense–",
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/02_MonoSm_Verso,I don’t know…,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/01_MonoLumiere_Lune,I don’t understand…,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/10_MonolithEntrance_Lune,I guess we head up then.,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/02_MonoGoblu_Sciel,"It’s her, but younger.",
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/01_MonoMonoco_Sciel,It’s that manor from Old Lumière!,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/02_Beach_Maelle,No… something’s different.,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/01_MonoOrange_Maelle,Oh.,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/01_MonoYellow_Lune,She’s old again.,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/03_PaintressStairway_Maelle,She’s there– I can feel her.,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/06_MonolithEntrance_Maelle,She’s up there.,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/02_MIManor_Lune,So that’s where it went.,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/03_MonoGoblu_Lune,"Teaching her children to paint, huh…",
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/03_MonoSeaCliff_Maelle,The chroma here… I can “read” it.,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/09_MonolithEntrance_Maelle,The real Paintress… Her heart is above us somewhere.,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/02_MonoMonoco_Lune,There was no fire damage on that one though.,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/01_MIManor_Sciel,This is the manor from Old Lumière…,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/05_MonolithEntrance_Maelle,Up– Up there– She’s– The Paintress-,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/01_MonoSm_Lune,"Verso, what was that?",
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/02_MonoLumiere_Sciel,"Verso, you ok?",
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/01_MonolithEntrance_Lune,We are… inside the monolith…,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/04_PaintressStairway_Monoco,"We need to be as prepared as possible. Once we go up, there’s no turning back.",
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/01_MonoSeaCliff_Maelle,We’re inside her mind… These are memories…,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/01_Beach_Lune,We’re… outside?,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/07_MonolithEntrance_Verso,What do you mean?,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/02_MonolithEntrance_Lune,"What was that thing? Why
did it help us inside?",
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/01_MonoFb_Lune,Who is she fighting?,
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/03_MonoLumiere_Verso,"Yeah, fine. Let’s keep moving, we’re almost at the top.",
ST_IWD_MonolithInterior/03_MonolithEntrance_Verso,…,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/02_VersoGroupResidences_Verso,Above a bakery near the centre. Um… Angelique’s Boulangerie! I ate there every morning. I wonder if it’s still there.,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/01_NocoVersoGone_Noco,"Don't worry, Verso runs off all the time. He's always ditching me and Monoco. He'll be back.",
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/01_LuneGroupWalk_Monoco,"Friends, I beg your forgiveness for landing us in this quagmire.",
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/01_NocoStillhere_Noco,Hihihi. I'm still here!,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/01_LuneGroupBuildings_Sciel,"How exactly did our piece of Lumière end up on an island, when the rest of the city is here?",
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/02_VersoGroupTreasure_Verso,I never said there was treasure.,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/01_NearCentre_Maelle,I think I’m close.,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/03_LuneGroupBuildings_Lune,"I wish we had more time, there’s so much to study here.",
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/02_OldLumiereIntro_Maelle,Is anyone still here?,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/03_VersoGroupResidences_Maelle,It’s called “Mathilde’s” now.,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/03_LuneGroupWalk_Sciel,"It’s ok, Monoco. Let’s move on, shall we?",
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/02_OLManor_Maelle,I… know this place…,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/03_OldLumiereIntro_Verso,Just Nevrons.,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/03_LuneGroupGestralLife_Monoco,Livelier. There were many more of us Gestrals back then. The Fracture tore our villages apart. Only a fraction of a fraction survived. Our forests are filled with Gestrals awaiting rebirth.,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/02_LuneGroupWalk_Lune,Mhm.,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/01_NocoFoundManor_Noco,"Oh oh, over there! That must be the place.",
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/02_LuneGroupBuildings_Lune,One of the great mysteries.,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/01_LuneGroupGestralLife_Sciel,"So Monoco, what was life like before the Fracture?",
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/04_OldLumiereIntro_Sciel,So this is where our piece of Lumière used to be. Before the Fracture ripped apart the world and threw us into the sea.,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/01_VersoGroupResidences_Maelle,"Speaking of home, where’d you live in Lumière?",
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/06_OldLumiereIntro_Verso,"The heart of the Paintress is in the centre, let’s go.",
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/02_LuneGroupGestralLife_Monoco,The world was smaller and cosier.,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/01_OLManor_Maelle,This manor’s intact… Why does it feel so familiar…,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/01_MaelleAlone_Maelle,"Verso, where did you go… I need to find Lune and Sciel. Quickly.",
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/01_VersoGroupTreasure_Noco,"Verso, where’s the treasure??",
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/03_VersoGroupTreasure_Noco,Wait a minute…!,
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/01_OldLumiereIntro_Monoco,"Welcome my friends, to Old Lumière.",
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/05_OldLumiereIntro_Lune,"We’re lucky it did, that’s probably the only reason we survived.",
ST_IWD_OldLumiere/04_VersoGroupResidences_Maelle,"When this is over, you should go and visit.",
ST_IWD_RdLune/01_Exp46Journals_Verso,Are they–,
ST_IWD_RdLune/02_RdLuneExp46_Lune,Here?,
ST_IWD_RdLune/03_Exp46Journals_Lune,It’s Amelie and Christophe. They used to come by our house for dinner.,
ST_IWD_RdLune/04_Exp46Journals_Verso,I’m sorry.,
ST_IWD_RdLune/03_AfterExp46Journals_Lune,Let’s head back to camp.,
ST_IWD_RdLune/02_Exp46Journals_Lune,My parents? No.,
ST_IWD_RdLune/01_RdLuneExp46_Verso,The 46 are nearby.,
ST_IWD_RdLune/05_Exp46Journals_Lune,They were good people.,
ST_IWD_RdLune/04_RdLuneExp46_Lune,When is it not?,
ST_IWD_RdLune/03_RdLuneExp46_Verso,Yeah. But getting to them might be tricky.,
ST_IWD_RdLune/02_AfterExp46Journals_Verso,You ok?,
ST_IWD_RdLune/06_Exp46Journals_Lune,[clears throat] Their journal must be around here.,
ST_IWD_RdLune/01_AfterExp46Journals_Lune,…,
ST_IWD_Reacher/01_ExploringWorkshop_Lune,All these inventions– Gustave would have loved to see this.,
ST_IWD_Reacher/01_Zone1_Sciel,Are they trying to fix things? Or break things?,
ST_IWD_Reacher/01_Zone3_Sciel,Did that Nevron just kick a different Nevron off the tower?,
ST_IWD_Reacher/04_Zone1_Maelle,Everything is.,
ST_IWD_Reacher/02_ReacherIntro_Maelle,I hate climbing…,
ST_IWD_Reacher/03_Zone1_Lune,Is this part of “the parable?”,
ST_IWD_Reacher/01_ReacherNoGo_Verso,I… We shouldn't go there.,
ST_IWD_Reacher/02_Zone3_Verso,Looks that way.,
ST_IWD_Reacher/01_AfterRenoirJournal_Maelle,Right. So simple.,
ST_IWD_Reacher/02_Zone1_Monoco,She Who Grasps The Sky. They’re jealous. They wish to destroy her work. Pull her back to the ground.,
ST_IWD_Reacher/01_ReacherIntro_Monoco,She Who Grasps the Sky.,
ST_IWD_Reacher/03_Zone3_Maelle,[amused exasperation],
ST_IWD_SeaCliff/01_PaintressShrine_Lune,A shrine to the Paintress.,
ST_IWD_SeaCliff/01_IfDestroyShrine_Sciel,Cathartic.,
ST_IWD_SeaCliff/01_SeaCliffEntry_Maelle,"I'm tired, can we camp first?",
ST_IWD_SeaCliff/02_IfDestroyShrine_Lune,"If you’re all done, we should really get going.",
ST_IWD_SeaCliff/02_Farm_Sciel,"Like old times, eh?",
ST_IWD_SeaCliff/01_Farm_Gustave,Looks like a farm.,
ST_IWD_SeaCliff/01_PathToLampmaster_Esquie,Ohohoh Florrie is over there!,
ST_IWD_SeaCliff/02_PathToLampmaster_Esquie,"Oooh, but I sense something scaryyy.",
ST_IWD_SeaCliff/02_PaintressShrine_Gustave,The Paintress destroyed our world. And someone built her a shrine?,
ST_IWD_SeaCliff/03_PaintressShrine_Lune,The weak-minded turn to whatever they can to explain the unknown.,
ST_IWD_SeaCliff/01_FirstCave_Sciel,These bodies– I don’t like this cave.,
ST_IWD_SeaCliff/04_PaintressShrine_Sciel,"When you’re at the mercy of a power you don’t understand, you might try anything.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/04_EndlessTowerArrival_Monoco,A proper challenge.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_BenisseurFirstStory_Lune,"Actually, I found it quite interesting. Could we try it again?",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_GestralDarkArena_Verso,"An old arena from the Village. Some gestrals built balloons to make it pretty, but they built so many that it started flying.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_EndlessTowerArrival_Verso,And create…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_TwilightSanctuarySakapate1_Verso,And they don’t like intruders.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_FrozenHeartsStalact_Verso,Aren’t they… terrifying?,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_FrozenHearts_Verso,Brings back memories.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/04_FrozenHearts_Sciel,Bromantic.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_FallingLeavesArrival_Verso,"Careful, some Expeditioners died here.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/04_RenoirsDraftEntry_Lune,Careful.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_TwilightSanctuarySakapate1_Verso,Careful. The Sakapatates around here are the best of the Village.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_TheMistress_Maelle,Clea…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_DoorMazePuzzlePassed_Verso,"Great, the door closed again.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_BenisseurAwakens_Maelle,"Great, what now?",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_CleaFlyingHouseArrival_Maelle,Hmm.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_JarCompleted_Lune,"Hmm. What did it mean by ""light""?",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_SimonBridge_Lune,Hmm…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_FrozenHeartsStalact_Monoco,Hmph.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_FrozenHeartsLastCave_Verso,How could they do this to these trains…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_CuratorLeftCamp_Maelle,I can do it.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_CuratorInCamp_Lune,I hope we can trust him…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_CompletedPortierKilled_Monoco,I knew it was a Nevron.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_SimonBridge_Verso,I sense… something powerful down this path.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_JudgeStandsMenacingly_Monoco,Is it looking for a fight?,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_YellowForest_Sciel,Is it… eating the mountain?,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_GestralFlyingCasino_Maelle,Is that a casino?,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_CleaFlyingHouseAtelier_Verso,It can’t be…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_DemineurCompleted_Maelle,It said something!,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_CompletedPortierKilled_Maelle,It tricked us.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_LandingInTheDark_Verso,It’s an ambush.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_FrozenHeartsArrival_Verso,It’s been a while since I’ve been here.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_PortierSpiritFirstEncounter_Lune,It’s possible they died before or during the Fracture. Or perhaps they called Nevrons something else.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_PortierSpiritFirstEncounter_Maelle,It’s weird that they don’t know about Nevrons.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_CleaFlyingHouseBoss3_Verso,Just one more.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/04_SimonBridge_Maelle,Let’s go.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_JarCompleted_Lune,Let’s keep an eye out for other Nevrons like this one. We might learn something.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_EternalIce_Lune,Let’s take the Eternal Ice back to Monoco’s Station.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_EternalIce_Lune,"Look, this Nevron is MADE of Eternal Ice.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_SimonBridge_Verso,Maybe we should turn back.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/05_CompletedPortierKilled_Monoco,Maybe…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_DoorMazePuzzleMiddle_Monoco,Me too. Where’s the fighting?,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_HexgaInterrogated_Lune,"More likely, she has allies or lieutenants, like the man on the beach.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_DanseuseDeath_Lune,Nevron mindsets vary more than I expected.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_GestralDarkArena_Verso,Oh so that’s where it was.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_DoorMazePuzzleStart_Sciel,"Oh, the exit just closed!",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_GestralBeach_Sciel,"Oh, this looks like fun!",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_RenoirsDraftEntry_Maelle,Oh.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_TwilightSanctuaryArrival_Lune,Oh.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_Gargant_Monoco,Ohoho! This one is huge!,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_FallingLeavesArrival_Lune,Okay.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_TwilightSanctuarySakapate1_Maelle,Okay.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_CleaFlyingHouseBoss1_Verso,"One down, three to go.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_FrozenHeartsStalact_Verso,"Remember those Stalacts, Monoco?",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_SacredRiverNoGo_Verso,Right. Not yet.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_TwilightSanctuaryArrival_Verso,"See the trees here? They’re Gestrals, waiting to be reborn.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_HexgaInterrogated_Maelle,So does that mean the Paintress has multiple forms?,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_DemineurKilled_Maelle,So much for trying to help…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_CompletedBourgeonKilled_Maelle,"Sorry, no hard feelings.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_DoorMazePuzzlePassed_Sciel,Spooky.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_CompletedPortierKilled_Verso,Sure you did.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_CuratorInCamp_Maelle,Surprised to find you here.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_CleaFlyingHouseBoss4_Verso,That should do it.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_DanseuseDeath_Monoco,That was a most beautiful dance.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_EndlessTowerArrival_Verso,That’s where she used to paint…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_EternalIce_Sciel,That’s why it was so tough.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_TroubadourBodies_Verso,That’s… unusual.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_SacredRiverNoGo_Verso,"The Sacred River. Monoco, should we…?",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_FallingLeavesArrival_Verso,There’s an abnormal Nevron roaming about and it has a taste for Expeditioner armbands.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_TwilightSanctuaryArrival_Verso,They’re queuing.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_CleaFlyingHouseArrival_Verso,This is where she lived.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_GestralBeach_Lune,This looks like a waste of time.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_GestralBeach_Maelle,This looks very Gestralish.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_BeachBravado_Verso,"This one’s dangerous, I’ll do it.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_BeachBravado_Monoco,"This one’s dangerous, I’ll do it.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_DoorMazePuzzleMiddle_Maelle,This place is giving me a headache.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_CleaFlyingHouseBoss2_Verso,"Two down, two to go.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_CleaFlyingHouseAtelier_Maelle,Verso…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_FrozenHeartsArrival_Sciel,Verso…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_FrozenHeartsLastCave_Monoco,Verso…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_JudgeStandsMenacingly_Verso,Watch out.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_JarKeyItemRetrieved_Lune,We could light something with this…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_YellowForestGlaise_Lune,We lay the trail.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_FrozenHearts_Monoco,We lived on this mountain together for some time.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_FrozenHeartsArrival_Verso,We used to ski here… Before the Fracture.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_CuratorInCamp_Maelle,Well at least we can upgrade our pictos.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_DoorMazePuzzleStart_Lune,We’ll have to go through the maze.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_RenoirsDraftEntry_Verso,We’re below the Monolith…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_TroubadourBodies_Lune,What happened here?,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_GestralDarkArena_Lune,What is it?,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_BenisseurFirstStory_Maelle,"What is this, a cryptic-story dispenser?",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_RenoirsDraftEntry_Verso,Where he was sealed.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_CuratorLeftCamp_Lune,Who’s going to upgrade our pictos now?,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/04_TheMistress_Monoco,Why did she make Nevron feet so pointy? I can’t polish them without poking myself! It’s terribly inconvenient.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_FrozenHearts_Lune,Why?,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_YellowForest_Maelle,Wow… That Nevron is the size of a mountain.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_EndlessTowerArrival_Maelle,Yeah…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_FrozenHeartsLastCave_Verso,"Yes, I still like trains.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/03_TheMistress_Maelle,"Yes, except for the ones on the Axon islands.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/05_TheMistress_Verso,"Yes, quite annoying.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/04_CompletedPortierKilled_Sciel,"You just wanted a fun fight, didn’t you?",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_BourgeonSkinAcquired_Lune,"You managed to get a decent chunk of skin, Maelle. We can give that to the small Bourgeon.",
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_TheMistress_Lune,Your sister created the Nevrons?,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_BourgeonSkinAcquired_Maelle,You’re welcome.,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/01_YellowForestVista_Maelle,[surprised emotion],
ST_IWD_SideLevels/02_SacredRiverNoGo_Monoco,…,
ST_IWD_SideLevels/06_TheMistress_Maelle,…,
ST_IWD_Sirene/01_SireneDancing_Verso,Don’t look at her for too long or you’ll go insane. I’ve seen people jumping off a cliff just from looking at her…,
ST_IWD_Sirene/01_TisseurDefeated_Verso,"Good job, no other expedition managed that.",
ST_IWD_Sirene/04_SireneDancing_Sciel,"I don’t think so, never seen it.",
ST_IWD_Sirene/03_WalkToSirene_Maelle,I swear I’ve seen this dance before.,
ST_IWD_Sirene/03_Coliseum_Lune,It feels like home.,
ST_IWD_Sirene/02_SireneDancing_Lune,It is… Mesmerising.,
ST_IWD_Sirene/03_SireneEntrance_Sciel,It’s beautiful… Feels surreal…,
ST_IWD_Sirene/02_WalkToSirene_Verso,"Lune, you’re ok, right?",
ST_IWD_Sirene/02_TisseurDefeated_Maelle,No other expedition had a Lumina converter.,
ST_IWD_Sirene/01_WalkToSirene_Lune,She’s even grander than I thought.,
ST_IWD_Sirene/02_SireneFinalCorridor_Verso,She’s waiting at the end of this tunnel.,
ST_IWD_Sirene/03_TheTisseur_Lune,So he creates all of that for her.,
ST_IWD_Sirene/02_Coliseum_Verso,Thank Expedition 67 for destroying a lot of walls to get further. Couldn’t progress without that.,
ST_IWD_Sirene/01_SireneEntrance_Lune,The architecture looks very different here.,
ST_IWD_Sirene/02_TheTisseur_Verso,"The tisseur, it works for Sirène.",
ST_IWD_Sirene/03_SireneFinalCorridor_Lune,Then we should prepare before we head there.,
ST_IWD_Sirene/03_SireneDancing_Maelle,This dance feels familiar. Was this kind of dancing taught in Lumière?,
ST_IWD_Sirene/02_SireneEntrance_Monoco,This kind of place never existed before the Fracture.,
ST_IWD_Sirene/01_Coliseum_Maelle,This place is huge.,
ST_IWD_Sirene/04_TheTisseur_Verso,We should take it out. It would definitely be an advantage against Sirène.,
ST_IWD_Sirene/01_SireneFinalCorridor_Monoco,We’re finally there.,
ST_IWD_Sirene/01_TheTisseur_Maelle,What's THAT?,
ST_IWD_Sirene/03_TisseurDefeated_Lune,Yet this victory feels hollow…,
ST_IWD_SpringMeadows/01_ExitCave_Lune,Flares!,
ST_IWD_SpringMeadows/01_Vista_Gustave,"Here we are, huh.",
ST_IWD_SpringMeadows/03_ExitCave_Lune,Hurry!,
ST_IWD_SpringMeadows/01_PianoHouse_Gustave,Is that— A house?,

Good thing Anthony upgraded all the climbing handholds, not only are they much easier to install in the cliff faces, they’re also a lot nicer to use. 

We’re setting the last few handholds tomorrow, then we can finally get out of these caverns and see the sun again. I can’t wait to rejoin the mountaineering team.

I still remember that first mountain we scaled. Watching the sun rise above the clouds was magical. But rappelling down as we set the handholds was pure exhilaration. 

I know some of the others chafe at being restricted to recon-only. I get it’s not very satisfying making maps and prepping trails while people are dying, but this prep work will pay off in the long run. It may not be glamorous, but truly essential work rarely is. Doesn’t make it any less important. And as the Expedition 69 motto says, we are literally laying a trail for the ones who come after.

Gigi and Edmond were leading. They were on a clean glide to the Monolith when they flew into some sort of barrier and just… gommaged away.

Our gliders are useless without a way past the barrier. Bernard is going to explore on foot, see if there’s an entrance. In the meantime, we might as well make ourselves at home.

We’ve finally installed the last set of grapple points, with only days to spare, and for the first time, I feel real hope. This is our gift, for all the Expeditions to come.

I am incredibly proud of our team. The interior of the Monolith is perhaps the harshest landscape we’ve encountered. The final set of grapple points were excruciatingly complex to place and required painstaking focus and skill.

But we were bold, we were ambitious, and we refused to stop. There’s no other group of people I’d rather be with, and it is an honour to die by their side.

It is fitting that we greet our end together, within the Monolith that has loomed over us for so long. Though this Nevron has won the battle, the Expeditions shall win the war.

We can hold the line for another few days but we need to find a way out, our water supply is running dangerously low. 

Focusing our strategy around healing was a smart move, but we can’t take down a Nevron like this with our weak firepower and our backs against the wall. We can keep the fighters healed for quite some time, but not without water. Even with water, we would eventually run out of stamina. 

For our allies who come after, sadly our lives may have proven that defence is both absolutely necessary and wholly insufficient.",

We’re born into a social contract, the terms of which are pre-set. We can neither negotiate nor decline. Our very first breath, that first wail as an infant, was deemed our consent. Before we can speak, before we even understand what it is that we’re born into, we’re bound.

Lumière operates a certain way. It favours a certain group and a certain outcome and if you question the Council, well, the Council’s going to question you. 

Push too hard to change things and you just might end up on the next Expedition.

So. Nothing ever changes. They just send us out to die. Dissenters. And the status quo continues. At least out here, I don’t have to pretend anymore.

Looks like our elemental-focused strategy didn’t pay off. Who would have thought some Nevrons would be immune to every element. 

We have discovered so much though. I suspect there is a deeper level of chroma beyond what pictos enable us to manipulate. 

The pull of chroma grows as we get closer to the Monolith. But thus far we’ve been unable to tap into those flows. 

Maybe Gustave’s idea to convert chroma from Pictos to… What did he call it? Lumina? Maybe that’s not so crazy after all.",

He says the blast just missed him and it was chaotic during battle so I probably misunderstood what I saw. BULLSHIT. Absolute BLOODY bullshit.

He and his father keep saying the Paintress is the solution, not the problem, but I don’t buy it anymore. I think they’re lying about what happened to Expedition Zero. Somehow everyone else died but they walked out without a scratch?

They were so… Brave… So that’s what it means to lay the trail… I survived and will continue on, but to all the heroes of my team I dedicate our journal. All of them were bleeding out from our battle with the terrifying Nevron roaming this area. Yet in their final moments, they used their bodies to create a bridge for those who come after. Expedition 35 is over but tomorrow comes.",
ST_JO_Entries/01_OldLumiere_Melanie,"Melanie, 5 February

The Brigadiers are overdue from their mission to the Monolith and we’ve lost half our remaining fighting strength to these creatures and their relentless assault. 

All adults have taken up arms, but I’m a bookkeeper, what am I supposed to do? Count them before they slaughter us? 

We’ve hidden the children. At least they’re warm and dry in the cellars, but rations are running low. Things are calmer now at the hospital, but that’s because most die before we can get to them.

I guess I’m living out of pure stubbornness at this point. Survival isn’t really survival anymore.

Everyone’s so quiet lately, afraid we’ll draw attention. Sometimes I talk to myself just to hear another human voice. 

Trevor, you promised I could die before you. You promised.",
ST_JO_Entries/01_Exp44_Exp44Nicolas,"Nicolas, Exp44

The idea was we’d only have to fool the first one. Then Jules can wear its carcass to trap the next, and so on, until we all have proper cover. 

But disguising ourselves as Nevrons has proven to be extremely ineffective, to say the least. Maybe they recognize each other by their chroma? 

Anyway, it was an utter failure. To any Expeditions that follow our trail: do NOT disguise yourselves as Nevrons. It… doesn’t work.",
ST_JO_Entries/01_Exp100A_Simon,"Simon

More and more of my mind is fading away. I must put my words down on paper before I lose myself entirely. 

My beautiful Clea… 

What did she do to you? That Paintress… She fooled me, she looked so much like you and I believed her story. She granted me the power to fell the Axons and enter the Monolith. 

I realised too late that she had warped my mind, that she had in fact taken you away, locked you somewhere I could never reach, and set me on a path to destroy your future.

But then I met Aline, who showed me that I could save you. With her help, I descended to the bottom of the Monolith, where Aline had sealed Him away. The one who brings the Gommage. The one who threatens our very existence. But his powers are strong and I am finding it harder and harder to fight his influence over my mind. 

My mind is breaking. My final thoughts are only of you. And I despair. But one day our suffering will end and we will find our way back to each other. In this life or another.",
ST_JO_Entries/01_Exp78_Exp78Maxance,"The 78 - Maxance

…stealing the airships, but we knew we had to try. And it WORKED. 

We deserve strong leaders, not those old fools on the Council, hiding under the Dome. Under their control, our people are condemned to a slow inevitable extinction. 

Their timid half-steps achieve NOTHING. The answers are NOT in Lumière. They are out HERE. 

Our only choice is to take matters into our own hands. Fortune favours the bold. We must forge ahead with CONVICTION.",
ST_JO_Entries/01_Exp51_Exp51Thibault,"Thibault, Expedition 51

…shortly after dawn. Death was a kindness, for Maxim was in a great deal of pain. Pain we could not help him carry. 

Tomorrow comes,
And it comes for us all.
May it bring you the gift of peace,
And not just the gift of sorrow. 

No one else will ever understand. Not the way my fellow expeditioners understand. Maxim. Clément. Fabien. Guillaume. Carla. 

We’re bound by something deeper than blood or love. There is a shared unity, a shared trust, born from all we’ve been through. 

We carry each other’s lives in our hands. There is no greater intimacy. I’m no longer lost. I know exactly who I am now. And exactly what I am capable of. 

Life is not easy. Life was never easy. But we have each other. And that makes all the difference.",
ST_JO_Entries/01_Exp47_Exp47Thomas,"Thomas of the 47th Drunken Brigade

Benjamin’s been calling us the “Drunken Brigade!” Ha! I love it. Yeah, we do our best work after a few. 

The trick is finding that PERFECT point where your nerves have calmed enough that your mind and body are one, but not so calm that your reactions are dulled. Some of the lads haven’t QUITE managed riding that edge, but I remain in full control of my body and thoughts! 

Oh, sounds like someone spotted another Nevron. Better fuel up for our next dance. FOR LUMIÈRE!",
ST_JO_Entries/01_Exp52_Exp52Theo,"Théo, 52nd Expedition

Merde, I can barely think straight. That hulking gestral broke my skull. What the fuck kind of “friendly fight” was that??

ST_JO_Entries/01_Exp48_Exp48Vincent,"Vincent, 48th

He wouldn’t listen, just kept running everyone into the ground. He acted as if he was the only true believer, that we had to trust him. Five dead and he wanted to double down.

Thomas not so subtly insinuated that Jean should be relieved of duty. Mutiny. Something I’d never have countenanced, yet I have a duty to them too.

It’s a gutting realisation, what has to be done. The mission is too important. The team is too important. We can’t just throw our lives away for nothing. I hate that it came to this, but he broke our trust. 

Under Expedition Code 23, Jean Fournier is hereby relieved of duty. I, Vincent Constantin, have assumed command and have designated Thomas Fliegauff as Lieutenant.",
ST_JO_Entries/01_Exp62_Exp62Virgile,"Virgile, Expedition 62

Eugène beat the rest of us to 100 kills, but I’m still three shy. I might need to do some solo hunting if I’m going to even up the score. 

Oh, I hear a big Nev coming, they count for double. If I kill it quick I can boost my score.",
ST_JO_Entries/01_Exp60_Exp60William,"William, Expedition 60

They mocked us when we said the human body is the strongest of them all. We trained relentlessly and now our bodies have achieved the pinnacle of human performance, with which we are able to crush our enemies! 

We are SO much more agile and aerodynamic without the heavy uniforms constraining our glorious muscles. With Leslie’s unstoppable training regime, WE ARE IMPERVIOUS. 

That’s how we were able to charge through that ghostly gommage barrier and reach the Paintress. But it seems we’ve been wrong about what she is. The Paintress is just as trapped as we. The real terror lies beneath the Monolith.

The rest of Expedition 60 marched on to confront him, while I was tasked to warn Lumière. But it seems I might have run out of time. One last swim separates me from Lumière, but even with my mighty muscles, I don’t know if I can outswim the Gommage.

So here I write my final message. Bare naked muscles will save the world! And don’t waste time on the Paintress, aim for the bottom of the Monolith!",
ST_JO_Entries/01_Exp84_Exp84Yasmine,"Yasmine, Monolith Year 84

My favourite theory is that she’s some crazy demonic maths teacher, and this is our punishment for failing at numbers! 

A load of superstitious hysteria, but at least we’re here now. It’s worth it just to walk these valleys. I’ve barely seen a meadow since Lady Genocide and her poison smoke took up residence. 

And the sky. I feel almost naked without the Dome above us. We’re so exposed, but it’s thrilling too. 

We landed at the exact spot where Expedition Zero touched ground and retraced their route, but there’s not a SINGLE scrap of cloth or body anywhere. 

Bloody hell, we’re out here chasing shadows, 15-year old shadows. I’m glad we restarted the Expeditions, but how the hell are we supposed to find them, no trail could last 15 years…",
