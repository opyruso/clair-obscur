# clair-obscur

This project is a simple static helper for Clair Obscur pictos. The source files
are located in `src/` and the production build is generated in `dist/`.
It now uses small React components for the header and footer. React and Babel
are loaded from a CDN so no additional build step is required.

## Development

Run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Build

Create the distributable files under `dist/`:

```bash
npm run build
```
